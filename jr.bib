@article{Kerner2001aJr,
abstract = {We solve the geodesic deviation equations for the orbital motions in the Schwarzschild metric which are close to a circular orbit. It turns out that in this particular case the equations reduce to a linear system, which after diagonalization describes just a collection of harmonic oscillators with two characteristic frequencies. The new geodesic obtained by adding this solution to the circular one, describes not only the linear approximation of Kepler's laws but also gives the right value of the perihelion advance (in the limit of almost circular orbits). We also derive the equations for higher order deviations and show how these equations lead to better approximations including the non-linear effects. The approximate orbital solutions are then inserted into the quadrupole formula to estimate the gravitational radiation from non-circular orbits.},

@article{Iben1984Jr,
abstract = {Formation frequencies of binary systems which may become Type I supernovae are estimated. Presupernova systems consist of a CO or He degenerate dwarf and a (potential) mass donor (main-sequence star = MS; low-mass red giant = RG; asymptotic giant branch star = AGB; CO or He degenerate dwarf = CODD or HeDD). Mass transfer is driven by nuclear evolution (E), capture from wind (W), a magnetic stellar wind (MSW), or gravitational wave radiation (GWR). For several scenarios, the composition of accretor, nature of donor, driving mechanism, and formation frequency (in 10-3 yr-1 per 1010 L_sun; in the B band), respectively, are the following: (1) CO, RG, E, 10-2- 10-3; (2) CO, AGB, W, 4; (3) CO, MS, MSW, 2; (4) He, MS, MSW, 2; (5) CO or He, near-MS, E+MSW, 3; (6) CO, CODD, GWR, 8; (7) CO, HeDD, GWR, 1; (8) He, HeDD, GWR, 5. The galactic Type I supernova frequency is 10.},
