\markboth{Declaration}{}

This dissertation is the result of my own work and includes nothing which is the outcome of work done in collaboration, except where specifically indicated in the text. All concepts, results and data obtained by others are properly referenced. I have profited from discussion with and suggestions from a number of colleagues who are thanked in the \nameref{acknowledgements}. The use of ``we'' in the main text reflects my stylistic preference and nothing more.

This dissertation is not substantially the same as any that has been submitted for another degree, diploma or similar qualification. However, many of the results presented have been published as journal articles. These are:

\end{quote}
which includes work from chapters \ref{ch:events} and \ref{ch:relax}. Explicit citation to any of these indicates work done in collaboration. This is done in \secref{P-M}, where the original derivation of \eqnref{ell} is due to Jonathan Gair, and I subsequently verified this (correcting a minus sign and a factor of $\sqrt{2}$); in \secref{Epicycle}, where the calculation of the epicyclic frequencies was done by Jonathan Gair, generalising an earlier result of mine for the non-spinning metric, and I checked this (again fixing a minus sign), and in \secref{GW-f-R}, where the gravitational wave constraints were calculated using code developed by Jonathan Gair.

This dissertation contains less than $6 \times 10^4$ words; evaluated using \texttt{TeXcount}, it contains $\sim 5.12 \times 10^4$ words.
