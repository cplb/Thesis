\section{Background and introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

Many, if not all, galactic nuclei have harboured a massive black hole (MBH) during their evolution \citep{Lynden-Bell1971, Soltan1982, Rees1984}. Observations have shown that there exist well-defined correlations between the MBHs' masses and the properties of their host galaxies, such as bulge luminosity, mass, velocity dispersion and light concentration \citep{Kormendy1995, Magorrian1998, Ferrarese2000, Gebhardt2000, Graham2001, Tremaine2002, Marconi2003, Haring2004, Graham2007, Graham2011}. These suggest coeval evolution of the MBH and galaxy \citep{Peng2007, Jahnke2011}, possibly with feedback mechanisms coupling the two \citep{Haiman2004, Volonteri2009}. The MBH and the surrounding spheroidal component share a common history, such that the growth of one can inform us about the growth of the other.

The best opportunity to study MBHs comes from the compact object in our own galactic centre (GC), which is coincident with Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Through careful monitoring of stars orbiting the GC, this has been identified as an MBH of mass $M_\bullet = 4.31 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ at a distance of only $R_0 = 8.33\units{kpc}$ \citep{Gillessen2009}.

According to the no-hair theorem, any black hole (BH) should be described completely by just its mass $M_\bullet$ and spin $a$, since we expect the charge of an astrophysical BH to be negligible \citep{Israel1967, Israel1968, Carter1971, Hawking1972, Robinson1975, Chandrasekhar1998}. The spin parameter $a$ is related to the BH's angular momentum $J$ by
\begin{equation}
J = M_\bullet ac;
\end{equation}
it is often convenient to use the dimensionless spin
\begin{equation}
a_\ast = \frac{cJ}{GM_\bullet^2}.
\end{equation}
As we have a good estimate of the mass, to gain a complete description of the MBH we have only to measure its spin; this shall give us insight into its history and role in the evolution of the Galaxy.

The spin of an MBH is determined by several competing processes. An MBH accumulates mass and angular momentum through accretion \citep{Volonteri2010}. Accretion from a gaseous disc shall spin up the MBH, potentially leading to high spin values \citep{Volonteri2005}, while a series of randomly orientated accretion events leads to a low spin value: we expect an average value $|a_\ast| \sim 0.1$--$0.3$ \citep{King2006, King2008}. The MBH also grows through mergers \citep{Yu2002, Malbon2007}. Minor mergers with smaller BHs can decrease the spin \citep{Hughes2003, Gammie2004}, while a series of major mergers, between similar mass MBHs, would lead to a likely spin of $|a_\ast| \sim 0.7$ \citep{Berti2008, Berti2007, Gonzalez2007}. Measuring the spin of MBHs shall help us understand the relative importance of these processes, and perhaps shall give a glimpse into their host galaxies' pasts.

Elliptical and spiral galaxies are believed to host MBHs of differing spins because of their different evolutions: we expect MBHs in elliptical galaxies to have on average higher spins than MBHs in spiral galaxies, where random, small accretion episodes have played a more important role \citep{Volonteri2007, Sikora2007}.

It has been suggested that the spin of the Galaxy's MBH could be inferred from careful observation of the orbits of stars within a few milliparsecs of the GC \citep{Merritt2010}, although this is complicated because of perturbations due to other stars, or from observations of quasi-periodic oscillations in the luminosity of flares believed to originate from material orbiting close to the innermost stable orbits \citep{Genzel2003a, Belanger2006, Trippe2007, Hamaus2009, Kato2010}, though there are difficulties in interpreting these results \citep{Psaltis2008a}.

%This latter method, combined with a disc-seismology model, has produced a value of the dimensionless spin of $a_\ast = 0.44 \pm 0.08$. To obtain this result \citet{Kato2010} have combined their observations of Sgr A* with observations of galactic X-ray sources containing solar mass BHs, to find a best-fit unique spin parameter for all BHs. However, it is not clear that all BHs should share the same value of the spin parameter; especially considering that the BHs considered here differ in mass by six orders of magnitude, with none in the intermediate range. Even if BH spin is determined by a universal process, we still expect some distribution of spin parameters \citep{King2008, Berti2008}. Thus we cannot precisely determine the spin of the galactic centre's MBH from an average including other BHs.

The spins of MBHs in active galactic nuclei have been inferred using X-ray observations of $\mathrm{Fe}$ $\mathrm{K}$ emission lines \citep{Miller2007, McClintock2011}. So far this has been done for a handful of other galaxies' MBHs, as shown in \tabref{X-ray}.

\end{table}
Estimates for the spin cover a range of values up to the maximal value for an extremal Kerr black hole. Typical values are in the intermediate range of $a_\ast \sim 0.7$ with an uncertainty of about $10\%$ on each measurement.

While we can use the spin of other BHs as a prior, to inform us of what we should expect to measure for the spin of the Galaxy's MBH, it is desirable to have an independent observation, a direct measurement.

An exciting means of inferring information about the MBH is through gravitational waves (GWs) emitted when compact objects (COs), such as stellar mass BHs, neutron stars (NSs), white dwarfs (WDs) or low mass main sequence (MS) stars, pass close by \citep{Sathyaprakash2009}. A space-borne detector, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) or the evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA), is designed to be able to detect GWs in the frequency range of interest for these encounters \citep{Bender1998, Danzmann2003, Jennrich2011, Amaro-Seoane2012a}. The identification of waves requires a set of accurate waveform templates covering parameter space. Much work has already been done on the waveforms generated when companion objects inspiral towards an MBH \citep{Glampedakis2005, Barack2009}; as they orbit, the GWs carry away energy and angular momentum, causing the orbit to shrink until eventually the object plunges into the MBH. These systems are typically formed following two-body encounters so that the initial orbits are highly eccentric; a burst of radiation is emitted during each periapse passage. These are extreme mass-ratio bursts (EMRBs; \citealt{Rubbo2006}). Assuming that the companion is not scattered from its orbit, and does not plunge straight into the MBH, its orbit evolves, becoming more circular, and it shall begin to continuously emit significant gravitational radiation in the LISA/eLISA frequency range. The resulting signals are extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs; \citealt{Amaro-Seoane2007}).

Studies of these systems have usually focused upon the phase when the orbit is close to plunge and completes a large number of cycles in the detector's frequency band, allowing a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to be accumulated. Here, we investigate high eccentricity orbits. These are the initial bursting orbits from which an EMRI may evolve, and are the consequence of scattering from two-body encounters. The event rate for the detection of such EMRBs with LISA has been estimated to be as high as $15\units{yr^{-1}}$ \citep{Rubbo2006}, although this has been subsequently revised downwards to the order of $1\units{yr^{-1}}$ \citep{Hopman2007}. Even if only a single burst is detected during a mission, this is still an exciting possibility since the information carried by the GW should give an unparalleled probe of the structure of spacetime of the GC. Exactly what can be inferred depends upon the orbit, which we investigate here. We go on to verify that an event rate of $\sim 0.8\units{yr^{-1}}$ is reasonable.

We make the simplifying assumption that all these orbits are marginally bound, or parabolic, since highly eccentric orbits appear almost indistinguishable from an appropriate parabolic orbit. Here ``parabolic'' and ``eccentricity'' refer to the energy of the geodesic and not to the geometric shape of the orbit.\footnote{Marginally bound Keplerian orbits (in flat spacetime) are parabolic in both senses.} Following such a trajectory an object may make just one pass of the MBH or, if the periapsis distance is small enough, it may complete a number of rotations. Such an orbit is referred to as zoom-whirl \citep{Glampedakis2002a}.

In order to compute the gravitational waveform produced in such a case, we integrate the geodesic equations for a parabolic orbit in Kerr spacetime. We assume that the orbiting body is a test particle, such that it does not influence the underlying spacetime, and that the orbital parameters evolve negligibly during the orbit such that they may be held constant. We use this to construct an approximate numerical kludge (NK) waveform \citep{Babak2007}.

In the following we investigate the properties of EMRBs as a means of studying MBHs. We begin in \secref{Geodesic} with the construction of the geodesic orbits; these trajectories are used for the NK waveforms as explained in \secref{Kludge}. In \secref{Signal} we establish what the LISA detectors would measure and how the signal would be analysed. This may be skipped with impunity by those familiar with the subject. In \secref{Waveforms} we look at our NK waveforms. We give fiducial power-law fits for SNR as a function of periapse radius, useful for back-of-the-envelope estimates. We confirm the accuracy of the kludge waveforms in \secref{Energy} by comparing the energy flux to fluxes calculated using other approaches. The typical error introduced by the NK approximation may be a few percent, but this worsens as the periapsis approaches the last non-plunging orbit. We explain how to extract the information from the bursts in \secref{Estimation}. Results estimating the measurement precision are presented in \secref{Results}. We construct a simple model to estimate event rates in \secref{Events}. The possibility of detecting bursts from extra-galactic sources is studied in \secref{Extragal}, where we find M32 to be promising. Finally, we conclude in \secref{End} with a summary of our results. EMRBs may be informative, but the event rate shall limit their usefulness.

At the time of writing, there is no currently funded mission. However, LISA Pathfinder, a technology demonstration mission, is due for launch at the end of 2014 \citep{Anza2005, Antonucci2012}. Hopefully, a full mission shall follow in the subsequent decade. Since there does not exist a definite mission design, we use the classic LISA design for the majority of this work. It is hoped that any future missions shall have comparable sensitivity, and studies using the LISA design are sensible benchmarks for comparison.

Throughout this work we adopt a metric with signature $(+,-,-,-)$. Greek indices are used to represent spacetime indices $\mu = \{0,1,2,3\}$ and lowercase Latin indices from the middle of the alphabet are used for spatial indices $i = \{1,2,3\}$. Uppercase Latin indices from the beginning of the alphabet are used for the output of the two LISA detector-arms $A = \{\mathrm{I}, \mathrm{II}\}$. Summation over repeated indices is assumed unless explicitly noted otherwise. Geometric units with $G = c = 1$ are used where noted, but in general factors of $G$ and $c$ are retained.

\section{Parabolic orbits in Kerr spacetime}\label{sec:Geodesic}

\subsection{The metric and geodesic equations}

Astrophysical BHs are described by the Kerr metric \citep{Kerr1963}. In standard Boyer-Lindquist coordinates the line element is (\citealt*{Boyer1967, Hobson2006}, section 13.7)
\begin{equation}
\dd s^2 = \frac{\varrho^2 \Delta}{\Sigma^2}c^2\dd t^2 - \frac{\Sigma \sin^2 \theta}{\varrho^2}\left(\dd \phi - \omega \dd t\right)^2 - \frac{\varrho^2}{\Delta}\dd r^2 - \varrho^2\dd \theta^2,
\end{equation}
where we have introduced functions
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\varrho^2 = {} & r^2 + a^2\cos^2\theta,\\
\Delta = {} & r^2 - \frac{2GM_\bullet r}{c^2} + a^2,\\
\Sigma = {} & \left(r^2 +a^2\right)^2 - a^2\Delta\sin^2\theta,\\
\omega = {} & \frac{2GM_\bullet ar}{c\Sigma}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
For the remainder of this section we use natural units with $G = c = 1$.

Geodesics are parametrized by three conserved quantities (aside from the particle's mass $\mu$): energy (per unit mass) $E$, specific angular momentum about the symmetry axis (the $z$-axis) $L_z$, and Carter constant $Q$ (\citealt{Carter1968, Chandrasekhar1998}, section 62). The geodesic equations are
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\varrho^2 \diff{t}{\tau} = {} & a\left(L_z - aE\sin^2 \theta\right) + \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta}T,\\
\varrho^2 \diff{r}{\tau} = {} & \pm \sqrt{V_r},\\
\varrho^2 \diff{\theta}{\tau} = {} & \pm \sqrt{V_\theta},\\
\varrho^2 \diff{\phi}{\tau} = {} & \frac{L_z}{\sin^2 \theta} - aE + \frac{a}{\Delta}T,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where we have introduced potentials
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
T = {} & E\left(r^2 +a^2\right) - aL_z,\\
V_r = {} & T^2 - \Delta\left[r^2 + \left(L_z - aE\right)^2 + Q\right],\\
V_\theta = {} & Q - \cos^2 \theta\left[a^2\left(1 - E^2\right) + \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right],
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
and $\tau$ is proper time. The signs of the $r$ and $\theta$ equations may be chosen independently.

For a parabolic orbit $E = 1$; the particle is at rest at infinity. This simplifies the geodesic equations. It also allows us to give a simple interpretation for the Carter constant: this is defined as
\begin{equation}
Q = L_\theta^2 + \cos^2\theta\left[a^2\left(1 - E^2\right) + \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right],
\end{equation}
where $L_\theta$ is the (non-conserved) specific angular momentum in the $\theta$-direction ($V_\theta = L_\theta^2$). For $E = 1$ we have
\begin{equation}
Q = L_\theta^2 + \cot^2\theta\, L_z^2 = L_\infty^2 - L_z^2;
\end{equation}
here $L_\infty$ is the total specific angular momentum at infinity, where the metric is asymptotically flat \citep{DeFelice1980}.\footnote{See \citet{Rosquist2009} for a discussion of the interpretation of $Q$ in the limit $G \rightarrow 0$, corresponding to a flat spacetime.} This is as in Schwarzschild spacetime.

\subsection{Integration variables and turning points}

In integrating the geodesic equations, difficulties can arise because of the presence of turning points, when the sign of the $r$ or $\theta$ geodesic equation changes. The radial turning points are at the periapsis $r\sub{p}$ and at infinity. We may locate the periapsis by finding the roots of
\begin{align}
V_r = {} & 2M_\bullet r^3 - \left(L_z^2+Q\right)r^2 + 2M_\bullet\left[\left(L_z - a\right)^2 + Q\right]r - a^2 Q = {} 0.
\end{align}
This has three roots, which we shall denote $\{r_1, r_2, r\sub{p}\}$; the periapsis $r\sub{p}$ is the largest real root.\footnote{We do not find the apoapsis as a (fourth) root to this equation as we have removed it by taking $E = 1$ before solving. This turning point can be found by setting the unconstrained expression for $V_r$ equal to zero, and then solving for $E(r)$; taking the limit $r \rightarrow \infty$ gives $E \rightarrow 1$ \citep{Wilkins1972}.}

We avoid the difficulties associated with the turning point by introducing angular variables that always increase with proper time \citep{Drasco2004}: inspired by Keplerian orbits, we parametrize our trajectory by
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{p}{1+e\cos\psi},
\end{equation}
where $e = 1$ is the eccentricity and $p = 2r\sub{p}$ is the semilatus rectum. As $\psi$ covers its range from $-\pi$ to $\pi$, $r$ traces out a complete orbit. The geodesic equation for $\psi$ is
\begin{align}
\varrho^2 \diff{\psi}{\tau} = {} & \left\{M_\bullet\left[2r\sub{p} - \left(r_1 + r_2\right)\left(1 + \cos\psi\right) \vphantom{\frac{r_1 r_2}{2r\sub{p}}} +  \frac{r_1 r_2}{2r\sub{p}}\left(1 + \cos\psi\right)^2\right]\right\}^{1/2}.
\end{align}
Parametrizing an orbit by its periapsis and eccentricity has the additional benefit of allowing easier comparison with its flat-space equivalent \citep{Gair2005}.

The $\theta$ motion is usually bounded, with $\theta_0 \leq \theta \leq \pi - \theta_0$; in the event that $L_z = 0$ the particle follows a polar orbit and $\theta$ covers its full range \citep{Wilkins1972}. The turning points are given by
\begin{equation}
V_\theta = Q - \cot^2\theta\, L_z^2 = 0.
\end{equation}
Changing variable to $\xi = \cos^2\theta$, we have a maximum value $\xi_0 = \cos^2\theta_0$ given by
\begin{equation}
\xi_0 = \frac{Q}{Q+L_z^2} = \frac{Q}{L_\infty^2}.
\label{eq:theta_0}
\end{equation}
See \figref{L_triangle} for a geometrical visualization.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{./images/Triangle}
    \caption{The angular momenta $L_\infty$, $L_z$ and $\sqrt{Q}$ define a right-angled triangle. The acute angles are $\theta_0$, the extremal value of the polar angle, and $\iota$, the orbital inclination \citep{Glampedakis2002}.\label{fig:L_triangle}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Introducing a second angular variable \citep{Drasco2004}
\begin{equation}
\xi = \xi_0\cos^2\chi.
\end{equation}
Over one $2\pi$ period of $\chi$, $\theta$ oscillates from its minimum value to its maximum and back. The geodesic equation for $\chi$ is
\begin{equation}
\varrho^2\diff{\chi}{\tau} = \sqrt{Q + L_z^2}.
\end{equation}

\section{Waveform Construction}\label{sec:Kludge}

We can now calculate the geodesic trajectory. The orbiting body is assumed to follow this track exactly; we ignore evolution due to the radiation of energy and angular momentum, which should be negligible for EMRBs. From this trajectory we calculate the waveform using a semirelativistic approximation \citep{Ruffini1981}: we assume the particle moves along the Kerr geodesic, but radiates as if it were in flat spacetime. This quick-and-dirty technique is known as a numerical kludge (NK), and has been shown to approximate well results computed by more accurate methods \citep{Babak2007}. It is often compared to a bead travelling along a wire. The shape of the wire is set by the Kerr geodesic, but the bead moves along in flat space.

\subsection{Kludge approximation}

Numerical kludge approximations aim to encapsulate the main characteristics of a waveform by using the exact particle trajectory (ignoring inaccuracies from radiative effects and from the particle's self-force), whilst saving on computational time by using approximate waveform generation techniques.

We build an equivalent flat-space trajectory by identifying the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates with a set of flat-space coordinates. We consider two choices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates with flat-space spherical polars $\{r\sub{BL},$ $\theta\sub{BL},$ $\phi\sub{BL}\} \rightarrow \{r\sub{sph}, \theta\sub{sph}, \phi\sub{sph}\}$, then define flat-space Cartesian coordinates \citep{Gair2005, Babak2007}
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x} = \begin{pmatrix}
r\sub{sph} \sin\theta\sub{sph}\cos\phi\sub{sph} \\
r\sub{sph} \sin\theta\sub{sph}\sin\phi\sub{sph} \\
r\sub{sph} \cos\theta\sub{sph}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
\item Identify the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates with flat-space oblate-spheroidal coordinates $\{r\sub{BL}, \theta\sub{BL}, \phi\sub{BL}\} \rightarrow \{r\sub{ob}, \theta\sub{ob}, \phi\sub{ob}\}$ so that the flat-space Cartesian coordinates are
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x} = \begin{pmatrix}
\sqrt{{r\sub{ob}}^2 + a^2} \sin\theta\sub{ob}\cos\phi\sub{ob} \\
\sqrt{{r\sub{ob}}^2 + a^2} \sin\theta\sub{ob}\sin\phi\sub{ob} \\
r\sub{ob} \cos\theta\sub{ob}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
These are appealing because in the limit that $G \rightarrow 0$, where the gravitating mass goes to zero, the Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates reduces to the Minkowski metric in oblate-spheroidal coordinates.
\end{enumerate}
The two coincide for $a \rightarrow 0$ or $r \rightarrow \infty$.

There is no well motivated argument that either coordinate system must yield an accurate GW; their use is justified {\it post facto} by comparison with results obtained from more accurate, and computationally intensive, methods \citep{Gair2005, Babak2007}. The ambiguity in assigning flat-space coordinates reflects the inconsistency of the semirelativistic approximation: the geodesic trajectory was calculated for the Kerr geometry; by moving to flat spacetime we lose the reason for its existence. This should not be regarded as a major problem; it is an artifact of the basic assumption that the shape of the trajectory is important for determining the character of the radiation, but the curvature of the spacetime in the vicinity of the source is not. By binding the particle to the exact geodesic, we ensure that the waveform has spectral components at the correct frequencies, but by assuming flat spacetime for generation of GWs they shall not have the correct amplitudes.

\subsection{Quadrupole-octupole formula}

Now we have a flat-space particle trajectory $x\sub{P}^\mu(\tau)$, we may apply a flat-space wave generation formula. We use the quadrupole-octupole formula to calculate the gravitational strain \citep{Bekenstein1973, Press1977, Yunes2008}
\begin{equation}
h^{jk}(t, \boldsymbol{x}) = -\frac{2G}{c^6r}\left(\ddot{I}^{jk} - 2n_i\ddot{S}^{ijk} + n_i\dddot{M}^{ijk}\right)_{t'\, =\, t - r/c},
\label{eq:octupole}
\end{equation}
where an over-dot represents differentiation with respect to time $t$, $t'$ is the retarded time, $r = \left|\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{x}\sub{P}\right|$ is the radial distance, $\boldsymbol{n}$ is the radial unit vector, and the mass quadrupole ${I}^{jk}$, current quadrupole ${S}^{ijk}$ and mass octupole ${M}^{ijk}$ are defined by
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
{I}^{jk}\left(t'\right) = {} & \intd{}{}{{x'}^j{x'}^kT^{00}\left(t', \boldsymbol{x'}\right) }{^3x'};\\
{S}^{ijk}\left(t'\right) = {} & \intd{}{}{{x'}^j{x'}^kT^{0i}\left(t', \boldsymbol{x'}\right)}{^3x'};\\
{M}^{ijk}\left(t'\right)  = {} & \recip{c}\intd{}{}{{x'}^i{x'}^j{x'}^kT^{00}\left(t', \boldsymbol{x'}\right)}{^3x'},
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
for energy-momentum tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$. This is correct for a slowly moving source. It is the familiar quadrupole formula \linebreak[0] (\citealt[section 36.10]{Misner1973}; \citealt[section 17.9]{Hobson2006}), derived from linearized theory, plus the next order terms. For a point mass, $T^{\mu\nu}$ contains a $\delta$-function which allows easy evaluation of the integrals.

Since we are only interested in GWs, we use the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge \citep[box 35.1]{Misner1973}.

\section{Signal detection and analysis}\label{sec:Signal}

\subsection{The LISA detector}\label{sec:Detector}

The classic LISA design is a three arm, space-borne laser interferometer \citep{Bender1998, Danzmann2003}. The arms form an equilateral triangle that rotates as the system's centre of mass follows a circular, heliocentric orbit, trailing $20^{\circ}$ behind the Earth. eLISA has a similar design, but  has only two arms, which are shorter in length, and trails $9^{\circ}$ behind the Earth \citep{Jennrich2011}.

To describe the detector configuration, and to transform from the MBH coordinate system to those of the detector, we use three coordinate systems: those of the BH at the GC $x_\bullet^i$; ecliptic coordinates centred at the solar system (SS) barycentre $x_\odot^i$, and coordinates that co-rotate with the detector $x\sub{d}^i$. The MBH's coordinate system and the SS coordinate system are depicted in \figref{BH_SS}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.42\textwidth]{./images/BH_SS_angles}
    \caption{The relationship between the MBH's coordinate system $x_\bullet^i$ and the SS coordinate system $x_\odot^i$. The MBH's spin axis is aligned with the $z_\bullet$-axis. The orientation of the MBH's $x$- and $y$-axes is arbitrary. We choose $x_\bullet$ to be orthogonal to the direction to the SS.}
   \label{fig:BH_SS}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The mission geometry for LISA/eLISA is shown in \figref{SS_LISA}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{./images/SS_LISA}
    \caption{The relationship between the detector coordinates $x\sub{d}^i$ and the ecliptic coordinates of the SS $x_\odot^i$ \citep{Bender1998, Jennrich2011}. The detector inclination is $\alpha = 60^{\circ}$.}
   \label{fig:SS_LISA}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
We define the detector coordinates such that the detector-arms lie in the $x\sub{d}$-$y\sub{d}$ plane as in \citet{Cutler1998}. We have computed the waveforms in the MBH's coordinates, but it is simplest to describe the measured signal using the detector's coordinates.

The strains measured in the three arms can be combined such that LISA behaves as a pair of $90^{\circ}$ interferometers at $45^{\circ}$ to each other, with signals scaled by ${\sqrt{3}}/{2}$ \citep{Cutler1998}. We denote the two detectors as I and II and use vector notation $\boldsymbol{h}(t) = \left(h\sub{I}(t), h\sub{II}(t)\right) = \left\{h_A(t)\right\}$ to represent signals from both detectors.

\subsection{Frequency domain formalism}

Having constructed the GW $\boldsymbol{h}(t)$ that shall be incident upon the detector, we may consider how to analyse the waveform and extract the information it contains. We briefly recap GW signal analysis, with application to LISA. A more complete discussion can be found in \citet{Finn1992} and \citet{Cutler1994}. Adaption for eLISA requires a substitution of the noise distribution, and the removal of the sum over data channels, since it would only have one.

The measured strain $\boldsymbol{s}(t)$ is the combination of the signal and the detector noise
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{s}(t) = \boldsymbol{h}(t) + \boldsymbol{n}(t);
\end{equation}
we assume the noise $n_A(t)$ is stationary and Gaussian, and that noise in the two detectors is uncorrelated, but shares the same characterisation \citep{Cutler1998}.

The properties of the noise allow us to define a natural inner product and associated distance on the space of signals \citep{Cutler1994}
\begin{equation}
\innerprod{\boldsymbol{g}}{\boldsymbol{k}} = 2\intd{0}{\infty}{\frac{\tilde{g}_A^\ast(f)\tilde{k}_A(f) + \tilde{g}_A(f)\tilde{k}_A^\ast(f)}{S\sub{n}(f)}}{f},
\label{eq:inner}
\end{equation}
introducing Fourier transforms
\begin{equation}
\tilde{g}(f) = \mathscr{F}\{g(t)\} = \intd{-\infty}{\infty}{g(t)\exp(2\pi i ft)}{t},
\end{equation}
and $S\sub{n}(f)$ is the noise spectral density. The signal-to-noise ratio is approximately
\begin{equation}
\rho[\boldsymbol{h}] = \innerprod{\boldsymbol{h}}{\boldsymbol{h}}^{1/2}.
\label{eq:SNR}
\end{equation}
The probability of a particular realization of noise $\boldsymbol{n}(t) = \boldsymbol{n}_0(t)$ is
\begin{equation}
p(\boldsymbol{n}(t) = \boldsymbol{n}_0(t)) \propto \exp\left[-\recip{2}\innerprod{\boldsymbol{n}_0}{\boldsymbol{n}_0}\right].
\end{equation}
Thus, if the incident waveform is $\boldsymbol{h}(t)$, the probability of measuring signal $\boldsymbol{s}(t)$ is
\begin{equation}
p(\boldsymbol{s}(t)|\boldsymbol{h}(t)) \propto \exp\left[-\recip{2}\innerprod{\boldsymbol{s}-\boldsymbol{h}}{\boldsymbol{s}-\boldsymbol{h}}\right].
\label{eq:sig_prob}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Noise curve}\label{sec:Noise}

LISA's noise has two sources: instrumental noise and confusion noise, primarily from WD binaries. The latter may be divided into contributions from galactic and extragalactic binaries. In this work we use the noise model of \citet{Barack2004}. The shape of the noise curve can be seen in \figref{Noise}. The instrumental noise dominates at both high and low frequencies. The confusion noise is important at intermediate frequencies, and is responsible for the cusp around $10^{-3}\units{Hz}$. eLISA shares the same sources of noise, but is less affected by confusion. Its sensitivity regime is shifted to higher frequencies because of the shorter arm length.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\begin{center}

\caption{The detector noise curves. The solid line indicates the analytic approximation of \citet{Barack2004} used in this work. For comparison, the dashed line is from the online LISA sensitivity curve generator (\url{http://www.srl.caltech.edu/~shane/sensitivity/}; \citealt*{Larson2000, Larson2002}). For bursts from the Galactic Centre we are most interested in the low-frequency region where the two curves are the same. The dot-dashed line shows the eLISA noise curve.\label{fig:Noise}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Window functions}

There is one remaining complication regarding signal analysis: since we are Fourier transforming a finite signal we encounter spectral leakage; a contribution from large amplitude spectral components leaks into surrounding components (sidelobes), obscuring and distorting the spectrum at these frequencies \citep{Harris1978}. This is an inherent problem with finite signals; it shall be as much of a problem when analysing signals from an actual mission as it is computing waveforms here. To mitigate, but unfortunately not eliminate, these effects, the time-domain signal can be multiplied by a window function. We have adopted the Nuttall four-term window with continuous first derivative \citep{Nuttall1981} for the results presented here.

\section{Waveforms and detectability}\label{sec:Waveforms}

\subsection{Model parameters}

The waveform depends on the properties of the MBH; the CO and its orbit, and the detector.

We assume the position of the detector is known. This is specified by $\overline{\phi}$ and $\varphi$. We chose the initial position so $\overline{\phi} = 0$ when $\varphi = 0$ \citep{Cutler1998}; this does not qualitatively influence our results.

We also treat the sky position of the MBH, given by $\overline{\Theta}$ and $\overline{\Phi}$, as known. These are taken as the coordinates of Sgr A*, as the radio source is expected to be within $20 r\sub{g}$ of the MBH \citep{Reid2003,Doeleman2008}. We use the J2000.0 coordinates \citep{Reid1999, Yusef-Zadeh1999}. These change with time due to the rotation of the SS about the GC; the proper motion is about $6\units{mas\,yr^{-1}}$, mostly in the plane of the galaxy \citep{Reid1999, Backer1999, Reid2003}. The position is already determined to high accuracy and an EMRB can only give weak constraints on source position, hence we shall not try to infer it.\footnote{For comparison, an EMRI, which should be more informative, can only give sky localisation to $\sim 10^{-3}~\mathrm{steradians}$ \citep{Barack2004, Huerta2009}.}

For our model, the input parameters left to infer are:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, widest=\:88--88.]
\item[1.] The MBH's mass $M_\bullet$. This is currently well constrained by the observation of stellar orbits about Sgr A* \citep{Ghez2008, Gillessen2009}, with the best estimate being $M_\bullet = (4.31 \pm 0.36) \times 10^6 M_\odot$. This depends upon the galactic centre distance $R_0$ as $M_\bullet = (3.95 \pm 0.06|\sub{stat} \pm 0.18|_{R_0, \, \mathrm{stat}} \pm  0.31|_{R_0, \, \mathrm{sys}}) \times 10^6 M_\odot (R_0 / 8\units{kpc})^{2.19}$, where the errors are statistical, independent of $R_0$; statistical from the determination of $R_0$, and systematic from $R_0$ respectively.
\item[2.] The spin parameter $a_\ast$. Naively this could be anywhere in the range $|a_\ast| < 1$; however it is possible to place an upper bound by contemplating spin-up mechanisms. Considering the torque from radiation emitted by an accretion disc, and swallowed by a BH, it can be shown that $|a_\ast| \lesssim 0.998$ \citep{Thorne1974}. Magnetohydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs produce a smaller maximum value of $|a_\ast| \sim 0.95$ \citep{Gammie2004}. The actual spin value could be much lower than this upper bound depending upon the MBH's evolution.
\item[3, 4.] The orientation angles for the black hole spin $\Theta\sub{K}$ and $\Phi\sub{K}$.
\item[5.] The ratio of the SS-GC distance $R_0$ and the CO mass $\mu$, which we denote as $\zeta = R_0/\mu$. This scales the amplitude of the waveform. Bursts, unlike inspirals, do not undergo orbital evolution, hence we cannot break the degeneracy in $R_0$ and $\mu$, and they cannot be inferred separately. The distance, like $M_\bullet$, is constrained by stellar orbits, the best estimate being $R_0 = 8.33 \pm 0.35\units{kpc}$ \citep{Gillessen2009}. The mass of the orbiting particle depends upon the type of object: whether it is an MS star, WD, NS or BH. Since we shall not know the $\mu$ precisely, we shall not be able to infer anything more about the distance to the GC.
\item[6, 7.] The angular momentum of the CO. This can be described using either $\{L_z, Q\}$ or $\{L_\infty, \iota\}$. We employ the latter, as the total angular momentum and inclination are less tightly correlated. Assuming spherical symmetry, we expect $\cos \iota$ to be uniformly distributed.
\item[8--10.] A set of coordinates to specify the trajectory. These could be positions at an arbitrary time. We use the angular phases at periapse, $\phi\sub{p}$ and $\chi\sub{p}$ (which determines $\theta\sub{p}$), as well as the time of periapse $t\sub{p}$.
\end{enumerate}
We are therefore interested in constraining $d = 10$ parameters. We shall use $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ to represent the set of these $d$ parameters.

\subsection{Waveforms}\label{sec:wave-ex}

\Figref{Examples} shows example waveforms to demonstrate some of the possible variations in the signal. All these assume the standard mass and position for the MBH as well as a $\mu = 10 M_\odot$ orbiting CO; other (randomly chosen) orbital parameters are specified in the captions. Radii are given in terms of the gravitational radius $r\sub{g} = GM_\bullet / c^2$.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
  \begin{center}
   \subfigure[{Waveform for $a_\ast \simeq 0.12$, $r\sub{p} \simeq 15.6 r\sub{g}$ and $\iota \simeq 2.1$.

   \subfigure[{Waveform for $a_\ast \simeq 0.74$, $r\sub{p} \simeq 3.2 r\sub{g}$ and $\iota \simeq 1.2$. The SNR for the spherical polar kludge waveform (plotted) is $\rho[\boldsymbol{h}\sub{sph}] \simeq 70600$, for the oblate-spheroidal kludge it is $\rho[\boldsymbol{h}\sub{ob}] \simeq 74900$.}]{\label{fig:Orbit_135} \includegraphics[width=0.475\textwidth]{./images/Fig_new_sph_h_135}}  
\caption{Example burst waveforms from the galactic centre. The strain $\widetilde{h}\sub{I}(f)$ is indicated by the solid line, $\widetilde{h}\sub{II}(f)$ by the dot-dashed line, and the noise curve by the dashed line. The kludge has been formulated using spherical polar coordinates.\label{fig:Examples}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The plotted waveforms use the spherical polar coordinate system for the NK. Using oblate-spheroidal coordinates makes a small difference: on the scale shown here the only discernible difference would be in \figref{Orbit_135}; the maximum difference in the waveform (outside the high-frequency tail) is $\sim 10\%$. In the other cases the difference is entirely negligible (except in the high-frequency tail, which is not of physical significance). This behaviour is typical; for the closest orbits, with the most extreme spin parameters, the maximum difference in the waveforms may be $\sim 30\%$. The difference is largely confined to the higher frequency components, which are most sensitive to the parts of the trajectory closer to the MBH: the change in flat-space radius for the same Boyer-Lindquist radial coordinate causes a slight shift in the shape of the spectrum. Enforcing the same flat-space periapsis gives worse agreement across the spectrum.

To examine the effect of the coordinate choice, we compare SNRs calculated using the alternative schemes for a selection of orbits. The orbits have periapse distances uniformly distributed in log-space between the innermost orbit and $100 r\sub{g}$. Each had a spin and orbital inclination randomly chosen from distributions uniform in $a_\ast$ and $\cos \iota$.\footnote{The innermost orbit depends upon $a_\ast$ and $\iota$, hence these are drawn first.} For every periapse, five SNRs were calculated, each having a different set of intrinsic parameters specifying the relative orientation of the MBH, the orbital phase and the position of the detector, drawn from appropriate uniform distributions. We take the mean of $\ln \rho$ for each set of intrinsic parameters.\footnote{The logarithm is a better quantity to work with since the SNR is a positive-definite quantity that may be distributed over a range of magnitudes \citep[sections 22.1, 23.3]{MacKay2003}. Using median values yields results that are quantitatively similar.} The MBH parameters were fixed as for the GC.

The ratio of the two SNRs is shown in \figref{Oblate_sphere}.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./images/Fig_SNR_ratio}
 \caption{Ratio of SNR for a waveform calculated using spherical polar coordinates to that for a waveform using oblate-spheroidal coordinates.\label{fig:Oblate_sphere}}
   \end{center}
\end{figure}
The difference from the coordinate systems is only apparent for orbits with very small periapses. There is agreement to $10\%$ down to $r\sub{p} \simeq 4 r\sub{g}$; the maximal difference may be expected to be $\sim 20\%$, this is for periapses that are only obtainable for high spin values.

Since the deviation in the two waveforms is only apparent for small periapses, when the kludge approximation is least applicable, we conclude that the choice of coordinates is unimportant. The potential error of order $10\%$ is no greater than that inherent in the NK approximation (see \secref{Energy}). Without an accurate waveform template to compare against, we do not know if there is a preferable choice of coordinates. We adopt spherical coordinates for easier comparison with existing work.

\subsection{Signal-to-noise ratios}

The detectability of a burst depends upon its SNR. To characterise the variation of $\rho$ we calculated SNRs for a range of orbits. These were generated as in \secref{wave-ex}, we used $\sim 10^4$ different periapse distances.

The bursts were calculated for a $1 M_\odot$ CO. From \eqnref{octupole}, the amplitude of the waveform is proportional to the CO mass $\mu$, and so $\rho$ is also proportional to $\mu$; a $10 M_\odot$ object would be ten times louder on the same orbit. To make results mass independent, we work in terms of a mass-normalised SNR
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}[\boldsymbol{h}] = \left(\frac{\mu}{M_\odot}\right)^{-1}\rho[\boldsymbol{h}].
\end{equation}

There exists a correlation between the periapse radius and SNR, as shown in \figref{SNR}.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./images/Fig_SNR}
    \caption{Mass-normalised SNR as a function of periapse radius. The plotted points are the values obtained by averaging over each set of intrinsic parameters. The best fit line is $\log(\hat{\rho}) = -2.69\log(r\sub{p}/r\sub{g}) + 4.88$. This is fitted to orbits with $r\sub{p} >  13.0 r\sub{g}$.\label{fig:SNR}} % and has a reduced chi-squared value of $\chi^2/\nu = 1.73$
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
Closer orbits produce louder bursts. To reflect this trend, we have fitted a simple fiducial power law,
\begin{equation}
\log\rho \simeq -2.7\log\left(\frac{r\sub{p}}{r\sub{g}}\right) + \log\left(\frac{\mu}{M_\odot}\right) + 4.9,
\label{eq:SNR-power-law}
\end{equation}
which is indicated by the straight line.\footnote{Using oblate-spheroidal coordinates instead of spherical polars gives a fit consistent to within $0.1\%$ as we have excluded the closest orbits.} This was done by maximising the likelihood, assuming $\ln \rho$ has a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation derived from the scatter because of variation in the intrinsic parameters. The power law is a good fit only for larger periapses. The shape is predominately determined by the noise curve. The change in the trend reflects the transition as from approximately power law behaviour to the bucket of the noise curve. Hence, we fit a power law to orbits with a characteristic frequency of $f_\ast = \sqrt{GM_\bullet/r\sub{p}} < 1 \times 10^{-3}\units{Hz}$, to avoid spilling into the bucket. Changing the cut-off within a plausible region alters the fit coefficients by around $0.1$.\footnote{The power law exponent $-2.7$ is inconsistent with $-13/4$ as predicted by the approximate model of \citet{Hopman2007}. This is the result of their approximate waveform model.}

The SNR shows no clear correlation with the other parameters (excluding $\mu$). However, the SNR is sensitive to the intrinsic parameters, in particular the initial position, and may vary by an order of magnitude.

Setting a threshold of $\rho = 10$, a $1 M_\odot$ ($10 M_\odot$) object would be expected to be detectable if the periapse distance is less than $27 r\sub{g}$ ($65 r\sub{g}$). \citet{Hopman2007}, assuming a threshold of $\rho = 5$, used an approximate form for the SNR based upon the quadrupole component of a circular orbit; their model, with updated parameters for the MBH, predicts bursts would be detectable out to $66 r\sub{g}$ ($135 r\sub{g}$). This is overly optimistic.

\section{Energy spectra}\label{sec:Energy}

To check the NK waveforms, we compare the energy spectra calculated from these with those obtained from the classic treatment of \citet{Peters1963} and \citet{Peters1964}. This calculates GW emission for Keplerian orbits in flat spacetime, assuming only quadrupole radiation. The spectrum produced should be similar to that obtained from the NK in weak fields, that is for large periapses; we do not expect an exact match because of the differing input physics and varying approximations.

In addition to using the energy spectrum, we also use the total energy flux. This contains less information than the spectrum; however, \citet{Martel2004} has calculated results for parabolic orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime using time-domain black hole perturbation theory . These should be more accurate than results calculated using the Peters and Mathews formalism.

We do not intend to use the kludge waveforms to calculate an accurate energy flux: this would be inconsistent as we assume the orbits do not evolve with time. We only calculate the energy flux as a sanity check, to confirm that the kludge approximation is consistent with other approaches.

\subsection{Kludge spectrum}

A GW in the TT gauge has an effective energy-momentum tensor (\citealt{Misner1973}, section 35.15)
\begin{equation}
T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{c^4}{32\pi G}\left\langle\partial_\mu h_{ij} \partial_\nu h^{ij}\right\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\langle\ldots\rangle$ indicates averaging over several wavelengths or periods. The energy flux through a sphere of radius $R$ is
\begin{equation}
\diff{E}{t} = \frac{c^3}{32\pi G} R^2 \int{\dd\Omega}\left\langle\diff{h_{ij}}{t}\diff{h^{ij}}{t}\right\rangle,
\end{equation}
with $\int{\dd\Omega}$ representing integration over all solid angles. From \eqnref{octupole} the waves have a $1/{r}$ dependence; if we define
\begin{equation}
h_{ij} = \frac{H_{ij}}{r},
\end{equation}
we see the flux is independent of $R$, as required for energy conservation, and
\begin{equation}
\diff{E}{t} = \frac{c^3}{32\pi G} \int{\dd\Omega}\left\langle\diff{H_{ij}}{t}\diff{H^{ij}}{t}\right\rangle.
\end{equation}
Integrating to find the total energy emitted
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{c^3}{32\pi G} \int{\dd\Omega}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{\dd t} \, \diff{H_{ij}}{t}\diff{H^{ij}}{t}.
\label{eq:integrate_E}
\end{equation}
Since we are considering all time, the localization of the energy is no longer of importance and it is unnecessary to average over several periods. Switching to Fourier representation $\widetilde{H}_{ij}(f) = \mathscr{F}\left\{H_{ij}(t)\right\}$,
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{\pi c^3}{4 G} \int{\dd\Omega}\int_{0}^{\infty}{\dd f} \, f^2 \widetilde{H}^{ij}(f)\widetilde{H}_{ij}^*(f),
\label{eq:total_E}
\end{equation}
using $\widetilde{H}_{ij}^*(f) = \widetilde{H}_{ij}(-f)$ as the signal is real. From this we identify the energy spectrum as
\begin{align}
\diff{E}{f} = \frac{\pi c^3}{4 G} \intd{}{}{}{\Omega} \, f^2 \widetilde{H}^{ij}(f)\widetilde{H}_{ij}^*(f).
\label{eq:NK_dEdf}
\end{align}

\subsection{Peters and Mathews spectrum}

For an orbit of eccentricity $e$ with periapse radius $r\sub{p}$, \citet{Peters1963} give the power radiated into the $n$th harmonic of the orbital angular frequency as
\begin{equation}
P(n) = \frac{32}{5}\frac{G^4}{c^5}\frac{M_\bullet^2\mu^2(M_\bullet + \mu)(1-e)^5}{r\sub{p}^5}g(n,e),
\label{eq:PM_P}
\end{equation}
where the function $g(n,e)$ is defined in terms of Bessel functions of the first kind
\begin{align}
g(n,e) = {} & \frac{n^4}{32}\left\{\left[J_{n-2}(ne) - 2eJ_{n-1}(ne) + \frac{2}{n}J_n(ne) + 2eJ_{n+1}(ne) - J_{n+2}(ne)\right]^2 \right. \nonumber \\*
 & + \left. \left(1 - e^2\right)\left[J_{n-2}(ne) - 2J_n(ne) + J_{n+2}(ne)\right]^2 + \frac{4}{3n^2}\left[J_n(ne)\right]^2\right\}.
% Line breaks follow Peters and Mathews paper
\end{align}
The Keplerian orbital frequency is
\begin{equation}
\omega_1^2 = \frac{G(M_\bullet + \mu)(1 - e)^3}{r\sub{p}^3} = (1 - e)^3\omega\sub{c}^2,
\label{eq:Kepler_freq}
\end{equation}
where $\omega\sub{c}$ is defined as the angular frequency of a circular orbit of radius $r\sub{p}$. The energy radiated per orbit into the $n$th harmonic, that is at frequency $\omega_n = n\omega_1$, is
\begin{equation}
E(n) = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_1}P(n);
\label{eq:E(n)}
\end{equation}
as $e \rightarrow 1$ for a parabolic orbit, $\omega_1 \rightarrow 0$ as the orbital period becomes infinite. The energy radiated per orbit is then the total energy radiated. The spacing of harmonics is $\Delta\omega = \omega_1$, giving energy spectrum
\begin{equation}
\left.\diff{E}{\omega}\right|_{\omega_n}\omega_1 = E(n).
\end{equation}
Changing to linear frequency $2\pi f = \omega$,
\begin{align}
\left.\diff{E}{f}\right|_{f_n}  = {} & \frac{128\pi^2}{5}\frac{G^3}{c^5}\frac{M_\bullet^2\mu^2}{r\sub{p}^2}(1-e)^2g(n,e) \\*
  = {} & \frac{4\pi^2}{5}\frac{G^3}{c^5}\frac{M_\bullet^2\mu^2}{r\sub{p}^2}\ell(n,e),
\label{eq:PM_spectrum}
\end{align}
where the function $\ell(n,e)$ is defined in the last line. For a parabolic orbit, we must take the limit of $\ell(n,e)$ as $e \rightarrow 1$.

We simplify $\ell(n,e)$ using the recurrence formulae \citep[section 2.12]{Watson1995}
\begin{align}
J_{\nu-1}(z) + J_{\nu+1}(z)  = {} & \frac{2\nu}{z}J_\nu(z)\\*
J_{\nu-1}(z) - J_{\nu+1}(z)  = {} & 2J'_\nu(z),\label{eq:J_derivative}
\end{align}
and eliminate $n$ using
\begin{equation}
n = \frac{\omega_n}{\omega_1} = (1-e)^{-3/2}\tilde{f},
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{f} = \omega_n/\omega\sub{c} = f_n/f\sub{c}$ is a dimensionless frequency. To find the limit we define two new functions
\begin{equation}
A(\tilde{f}) = \lim_{e\rightarrow 1}\left\{\frac{J_n(ne)}{(1-e)^{1/2}}\right\}; \quad B(\tilde{f}) = \lim_{e\rightarrow 1}\left\{\frac{J'_n(ne)}{1-e}\right\}.
\end{equation}
To give a well-defined energy spectrum, both of these must be finite.

The Bessel function has an integral representation
\begin{equation}
J_\nu(z) = \recip{\pi}\intd{0}{\pi}{\cos(\nu\vartheta - z\sin\vartheta)}{\vartheta};
\end{equation}
we want the limit of this for $\nu \rightarrow \infty$, $z \rightarrow \infty$, with $z \leq \nu$. Using the stationary phase approximation, the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the regime in which the argument of the cosine is approximately zero \citep[sections 8.2, 8.43]{Watson1995}:
\begin{align}
J_\nu(z)  \sim {} & \recip{\pi}\intd{0}{\pi}{\cos\left(\nu\vartheta - z\vartheta + \frac{z}{6}\vartheta^3\right)}{\vartheta}\\*
  \sim {} & \recip{\pi}\intd{0}{\infty}{\cos\left(\nu\vartheta - z\vartheta + \frac{z}{6}\vartheta^3\right)}{\vartheta};
\end{align}
this last expression is an Airy integral and has a standard form \citep[section 6.4]{Watson1995}
\begin{equation}
\intd{0}{\infty}{\cos(t^3 + xt)}{t} = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{3}K_{1/3}\left(\frac{2x^{3/2}}{3^{3/2}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $K_\nu(z)$ is a modified Bessel function of the second kind. Using this to evaluate the limit gives
\begin{equation}
J_\nu(z) \sim \recip{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2(\nu - z)}{3z}}K_{1/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}}{3}\sqrt{\frac{(\nu -z)^3}{z}}\right).
\label{eq:J_nu}
\end{equation}
For our case,
\begin{equation}
J_n(ne) \sim \recip{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}(1-e)^{1/2}K_{1/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right),
\end{equation}
and the first limiting function is well defined,
\begin{equation}
A(\tilde{f}) = \recip{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}K_{1/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right).
\end{equation}

To find the derivative we combine equations \eqref{eq:J_derivative} and \eqref{eq:J_nu}, and expand to lowest order yielding
\begin{align}
J'_n(ne) \sim {} & -\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}(1-e)\left[2^{3/2}K'_{1/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right) + \recip{\tilde{f}}K_{1/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right)\right].
\end{align}
We may re-express the derivative using the recurrence formula \citep[section 3.71]{Watson1995}
\begin{equation}
K_{\nu-1}(z) + K_{\nu+1}(z) = -2K'_\nu(z)
\end{equation}
to give
\begin{align}
J'_n(ne)  \sim {} & \frac{1-e}{\sqrt{3}\pi}\left[K_{-2/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right) + K_{4/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right) - \recip{\sqrt{2}\tilde{f}}K_{1/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right)\right].
\end{align}
And so finally we obtain the well-defined
\begin{align}
B(\tilde{f})  = {} & \recip{\sqrt{3}\pi}\left[K_{-2/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right) + K_{4/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right) - \recip{\sqrt{2}\tilde{f}}K_{1/3}\left(\frac{2^{3/2}\tilde{f}}{3}\right)\right].
\end{align}

Having obtained expressions for $A(\tilde{f})$ and $B(\tilde{f})$ in terms of standard functions, we can calculate the energy spectrum for a parabolic orbit. From \eqnref{PM_spectrum}
\begin{equation}
\diff{E}{f} = \frac{4\pi^2}{5}\frac{G^3}{c^5}\frac{M_\bullet^2\mu^2}{r\sub{p}^2}\ell\left(\frac{f}{f\sub{c}}\right),
\label{eq:PM_dEdf}
\end{equation}
where we have used the limit
\begin{align}
\ell(\tilde{f})  = {} & \left[8\tilde{f}^2B(\tilde{f}) - 2\tilde{f}A(\tilde{f})\right]^2 + \left(128\tilde{f}^4 + \frac{4\tilde{f}^2}{3}\right)\left[A(\tilde{f})\right]^2.
\label{eq:ell}
\end{align}
This agrees with the $e = 1$ result of \citet{Turner1977}, which was computed by direct integration along unbound orbits. \Figref{ell} shows how $\ell(n,e)$ changes with eccentricity including our result for a parabolic encounter. Although more power is radiated into higher harmonics, the peak of the spectrum does not move much: it is always between $f = f\sub{c}$ and $f = 2 f\sub{c}$, with $f = 2 f\sub{c}$ for $e = 0$ and $f \simeq 1.637 f\sub{c}$ for $e = 1$.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Total Energy}

To check the validity of this limit we can calculate the total energy radiated by integrating \eqnref{PM_dEdf} over all frequencies, or by summing the energy radiated into each harmonic. These must yield the same result. Summing:
\begin{equation}
E\sub{sum} = \frac{64\pi}{5}\frac{G^3}{c^5}\frac{M_\bullet^2\mu^2}{r\sub{p}^2}\omega\sub{c}(1-e)^{7/2}\sum_n g(n,e),
\end{equation}
where we have used equations \eqref{eq:PM_P}, \eqref{eq:Kepler_freq} and \eqref{eq:E(n)}. \citet{Peters1963} provide the result
\begin{equation}
\sum_n g(n,e) = \frac{1 + (73/24)e^2 + (37/96)e^4}{(1-e^2)^{7/2}}.
\end{equation}
Using this,
\begin{equation}
E\sub{sum} = \frac{64\pi}{5}\frac{G^3}{c^5}\frac{M_\bullet^2\mu^2}{r\sub{p}^2}\omega\sub{c}\frac{1 + (73/24)e^2 + (37/96)e^4}{(1+e)^{7/2}},
\end{equation}
which is perfectly well behaved as $e \rightarrow 1$,
\begin{equation}
E\sub{sum} = \frac{85\pi}{2^{5/2}3}\frac{G^3}{c^5}\frac{M_\bullet^2\mu^2}{r\sub{p}^2}\omega\sub{c}.
\label{eq:PM_total}
\end{equation}
Integrating the energy spectrum \eqnref{PM_dEdf} gives
\begin{equation}
E\sub{int} = \frac{2\pi}{5}\frac{G^3}{c^5}\frac{M_\bullet^2\mu^2}{r\sub{p}^2}\omega\sub{c}\intd{0}{\infty}{\ell(\tilde{f})}{\tilde{f}}.
\end{equation}
The integral can be evaluated numerically as
\begin{equation}
\intd{0}{\infty}{\ell(\tilde{f})}{\tilde{f}} = 12.5216858\ldots = \frac{425}{2^{7/2}3}.
\end{equation}
The two total energies are consistent, $E\sub{int} = E\sub{sum}$.

\subsection{Comparison}

Two energy spectra are plotted in \figref{Energy} for orbits with periapses of $r\sub{p} = 15.0 r\sub{g}$, $30.0 r\sub{g}$ and $60.0 r\sub{g}$.

The high frequency tail is the result of spectral leakage.\label{fig:Energy}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
The two spectra appear to be in good agreement, showing the same general shape in the weak-field limit. The NK spectrum is more tightly peaked, but is always within a factor of $2$ at the apex. The peak of the spectrum is shifted to a marginally higher frequency in the NK spectrum primarily because of the addition of the current quadrupole and mass octupole terms.

Comparing the total energy fluxes, ratios of the various energies are plotted in \figref{Energy_ratio}.
\begin{figure}[!htp]

The solid line shows the ratio of the numerical kludge and Martel energies $E\sub{NK}/E\sub{M}$; the dashed line shows the ratio of the NK energy calculated using only the mass quadrupole term and the Martel energy $E\sub{NK(Q)}/E\sub{M}$; the dot-dashed line shows the ratio of the quadrupole and quadrupole-octupole NK energies $E\sub{NK(Q)}/E\sub{NK}$, and the dotted line shows the ratio of the Peters and Mathews and quadrupole NK energies $E\sub{PM}/E\sub{NK(Q)}$. The spots show the mapping between the two abscissa scales. Compare with figure 4 of \citet{Gair2005}.\label{fig:Energy_ratio}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
We introduce an additional energy here, the quadrupole NK energy $E\sub{NK(Q)}$. This allows easier comparison with the Peters and Mathews energy which includes only quadrupole radiation. It can be calculated in three ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Inserting the waveform $\widetilde{h}(f)$ generated including only the mass quadrupole term in \eqnref{octupole} into \eqnref{total_E} and integrating. This is equivalent to the method used to calculate $E\sub{NK}$.
\item Numerically integrating the quadrupole GW luminosity (\citealt{Misner1973}, section 36.7; \citealt{Hobson2006}, section 18.7)
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{G}{5c^9}\intd{}{}{\dddot{\Ibar}_{ij}\dddot{\Ibar}^{ij}}{t},
\label{eq:E_quad}
\end{equation}
where $\Ibar_{ij} = I_{ij} - (1/3)I\delta_{ij}$ is the reduced mass quadrupole tensor. We can obtain this from \eqnref{integrate_E}, by integrating over all angles when the waveform only contains the mass quadrupole component. This has the advantage of avoiding the effects of spectral leakage or the influence of window functions.
\item Using the analytic expressions for the integral \eqnref{E_quad} given in appendix A of \citet{Gair2005}.
\end{enumerate}
All three agree to within computational error. No difference is visible on the scale plotted in \figref{Energy_ratio}. This demonstrates the validity of the code.

We have used the amount of rotation $\Delta\phi$ as a convenient measure for the abscissa. For an equatorial orbit in Kerr spacetime,
\begin{align}
\Delta\phi  = {} & 2\intd{r\sub{p}}{\infty}{\diff{\phi}{r}}{r} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{M_\bullet}}L_z\intd{r\sub{p}}{\infty}{\frac{r^2 - 2M_\bullet(1 - a/L_z)r}{(r^2 - 2M_\bullet r + a^2)w}}{r},
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
w^2 = r^3 - \frac{L_z^2}{2M_\bullet}r^2 + (L_z - a)^2r;
\end{equation}
$L_z$ is the specific angular momentum about the $z$-axis; $a$ is the spin parameter, and we have adopted units with $G = c = 1$. We shall find it useful to define
\begin{equation}
r_\pm = M_\bullet \pm \sqrt{M_\bullet^2 - a^2},
\end{equation}
and the two nonzero roots of the cubic $w^2$
\begin{equation}
r_{\mathrm{p},\,1} = \frac{L_z^2}{4M_\bullet} \pm \sqrt{\frac{L_z^4}{16M_\bullet^2} - (L_z -a)^2};
\end{equation}
the periapsis is the larger root $r\sub{p} > r_1$. This equation implicitly gives $L_z$ as a function of $r\sub{p}$. The integral may be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\Delta\phi = \sqrt{\frac{2}{M}}L_z\intd{r\sub{p}}{\infty}{\recip{w}\left(1 + \frac{\alpha_+}{r-r_+} + \frac{\alpha_-}{r-r_-}\right)}{r},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\alpha_\pm = \pm\frac{2Mar_\pm - a^2L_z}{2L_z\sqrt{M^2-a^2}}.
\end{equation}
This may be evaluated using elliptic integrals \citep[3.131.8, 3.137.8]{Gradshteyn2000}
\begin{equation}
\Delta\phi = 2 L_z \sqrt{\frac{2}{r\sub{p}M}}\left[\frac{\alpha_+}{r_+}\Pi\left(\frac{r_+}{r\sub{p}}\middle|\frac{r_1}{r\sub{p}}\right) + \frac{\alpha_-}{r_-}\Pi\left(\frac{r_-}{r\sub{p}}\middle|\frac{r_1}{r\sub{p}}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
where $\Pi(n|m) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}{\dd\vartheta/(1-n\sin^2\vartheta)\sqrt{1-m\sin^2\vartheta}}$ is the complete elliptic integral of the third kind. In the limit of $a \rightarrow 0$ we recover the Schwarzschild result \citep{Cutler1994}
\begin{equation}
\Delta\phi =  2 L_z\sqrt{\frac{2}{r\sub{p}M}}K\left(\frac{r_1}{r\sub{p}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $K(m) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}{\dd\vartheta/\sqrt{1-m\sin^2\vartheta}}$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.

The ratios all tend towards one in the weak field, as required, but differences become more pronounced in the strong field. The NK energy is larger than the Peters and Mathews result $E\sub{PM}$. This behaviour has been seen before for high eccentricity orbits about a non-spinning BH \citep{Gair2005}. It may be explained by considering the total path length for the different orbits: the Peters and Mathews spectrum assumes a Keplerian orbit, the orbit in Kerr geometry rotates more than this. The greater path length leads to increased emission of GWs and a larger energy flux. Our bead must travel further along its wire. A good proxy for the path length is the angle of rotation $\Delta\phi$; this is $2\pi$ for a Keplerian orbit, in Kerr the angle should be $2\pi$ in the limit of an infinite periapsis, whereas for a periapsis small enough that the orbit shows zoom-whirl behaviour, the total angle may be many times $2\pi$. There is a reasonable correlation between the amount of rotation $2\pi/\Delta\phi$ and the ratio of energies.

Error in the NK energy compared with the time-domain black hole perturbation theory results of Martel comes from two sources: the neglecting of higher order multipole contributions and the ignoring of background curvature. The contribution of the former can be estimated by looking at the difference in the NK energy by including the current quadrupole and mass octupole terms. From \figref{Energy_ratio} we see that these terms give a negligible contribution in the weak field, but the difference is $\sim20\%$ in the strong field. This explains why the Martel energy $E\sub{M}$ is greater in the strong field, as it includes contributions from all multipoles. Neglecting the background curvature increases the NK energy relative to $E\sub{M}$. This partially cancels out the error introduced by not including higher order terms: this accidentally leads to $E\sub{NK(Q)}$ being more accurate than $E\sub{NK}$ for $r\sub{p} \gtrsim 10 r\sub{g}$ \citep{Tanaka1993}.

From the level of agreement we may be confident that the NK waveforms are a reasonable approximation. The difference in energy flux is only greater than $10\%$ for very strong fields $r\sub{p} \simeq 4 r\sub{g}$; since this is dependent on the square of the waveform, typical accuracy in the waveform may be $\sim 5\%$ \citep{Gair2005,Tanaka1993}. This is more significant than the variation in waveforms we generally found using the two alternative coordinate systems for the NK (in this case the two coincide because $a_\ast = 0$).

\section{Parameter estimation}\label{sec:Estimation}

Having detected a signal, we are interested in what we can learn about the source. We have an inference problem that can be solved by  application of Bayes' Theorem (\citealt{Jaynes2003}, chapter 4): the probability distribution for our parameters given that we have detected the signal $\boldsymbol{s}(t)$ is given by the posterior
\begin{equation}
p(\boldsymbol{\lambda}|\boldsymbol{s}(t)) = \frac{p(\boldsymbol{s}(t)|\boldsymbol{\lambda})p(\boldsymbol{\lambda})}{p(\boldsymbol{s}(t))}.
\end{equation}
Here $p(\boldsymbol{s}(t)|\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ is the likelihood of the parameters, $p(\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ is the prior probability distribution for the parameters, and the evidence $p(\boldsymbol{s}(t)) = \intd{}{}{p(\boldsymbol{s}(t)|\boldsymbol{\lambda})}{^d \lambda}$ is, for our purposes, a normalising constant. The likelihood depends upon the realization of noise. If parameters $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_0$ define a waveform $\boldsymbol{h}_0(t) = \boldsymbol{h}(t; \boldsymbol{\lambda}_0)$, the probability that we observe signal $\boldsymbol{s}(t)$ GW is given by \eqnref{sig_prob}, so the likelihood is
\begin{equation}
p(\boldsymbol{s}(t)|\boldsymbol{\lambda}_0) \propto \exp\left[-\recip{2}\innerprod{\boldsymbol{s}-\boldsymbol{h}_0}{\boldsymbol{s}-\boldsymbol{h}_0}\right].
\label{eq:likelihood}
\end{equation}
If we were to define this as a probability distribution for the parameters $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$, the modal values are the maximum-likelihood (ML) parameters $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\sub{ML}$. The waveform $\boldsymbol{h}(t; \boldsymbol{\lambda}\sub{ML})$ is the signal closest to $\boldsymbol{s}(t)$, where distance is defined using the inner product (\ref{eq:inner}) \citep{Cutler1994}.

To discover if any parameters can be accurately inferred, we must characterise the form of the posterior. To map out the posterior we employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach.

\subsection{Markov chain Monte Carlo methods}

MCMC methods are widely used for inference problems; they are a family of algorithms for integrating over complicated distributions and are efficient for high-dimensional problems \citep[chapter 29]{MacKay2003}. Parameter space is explored by constructing a chain of $N$ samples. The distribution of points visited by the chain maps out the underlying distribution; this becomes asymptotically exact as $N \rightarrow \infty$. Samples are added sequentially, if the current state is $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_n$ a new point $\boldsymbol{\lambda}^\ast$ is drawn and accepted with probability
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A} = \min\left\{\frac{\pi(\boldsymbol{\lambda}^\ast)\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\lambda}^\ast)\mathcal{Q}(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_n;\,\boldsymbol{\lambda}^\ast)}{\pi(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_n)\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_n)\mathcal{Q}(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_n;\,\boldsymbol{\lambda}^\ast)}, 1\right\},
\end{equation}
setting $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{n + 1} = \boldsymbol{\lambda}^\ast$, where $\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ is the likelihood, in our case from \eqnref{likelihood}; $\pi(\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ is the prior, and $\mathcal{Q}$ is a proposal distribution. If the move is not accepted  $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{n + 1} = \boldsymbol{\lambda}_n$. This is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \citep{Metropolis1953,Hastings1970}.

Waiting long enough yields an exact posterior, but it is desirable for the MCMC to converge quickly. This requires a suitable choice for the proposal distribution, which can be difficult, since we do not yet know the shape of the target distribution.

One method to define the proposal is to use the previous results in the chain and refine $\mathcal{Q}$ by learning from these. Such approaches are known as adaptive methods. Updating using previous points means that the chain is no longer Markovian. Care must be taken to ensure that ergodicity is preserved and convergence obtained \citep{Roberts2007,Andrieu2008}. To avoid this complication, we follow \citet{Haario1999}, and use the adapting method as a burn in phase. We have an initial phase where the proposal is updated based upon accepted points. After this we fix the proposal and proceed as for a standard MCMC. By only using samples from the second part, we guarantee that the chain is Markovian and ergodic, whilst still enjoying the benefits of a tailor-made proposal. After only a finite number of samples we cannot assess the optimality of this \citep{Andrieu2008}, but the method is still effective.

To tune $\mathcal{Q}$, we use an approach based upon the adaptive Metropolis algorithm \citep{Haario2001}. The proposal is taken to be a multivariate normal distribution centred upon the current point, the covariance of which is
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{C} = s \left(\boldsymbol{V}_n + \varepsilon\boldsymbol{C}_0\right),
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{V}_n$ is the covariance of the accepted points $\{\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1,\ldots,\boldsymbol{\lambda}_n\}$, $s$ is a scaling factor that controls the step size, $\varepsilon$ is a small positive constant (typically $0.0025$), and $\boldsymbol{C}_0$ is a constant matrix included to ensure ergodicity.

Our adaptation is run in three phases. The initial phase is to get the chain moving. For this $\boldsymbol{C}_0\super{init}$ is a diagonal matrix with elements calibrated from initial one dimensional MCMCs. This finishes after $N\sub{init}$ accepted points.

For the second phase, we use the proposal covariance from the initial phase $\boldsymbol{C}\super{init}$ for $\boldsymbol{C}_0\super{main}$. We reset the covariance of the accepted points so that it only includes points from this phase. This is the main adaptation phase and lasts until $N\sub{main}$ points have been accepted.

In the final adaptation phase we restart the chain at the true parameter values. We no longer update the shape of the covariance ($\boldsymbol{V}_n$ remains fixed), but adjust the step size $s$ to tune the acceptance rate; it is then fixed, along with everything else, for the final MCMC.

Throughout the adaptation, we update the step size $s$ after every $100$ trial points (whether or not they are accepted). While updating, the covariance $\boldsymbol{V}_n$ changes after every $1000$ trial points. We set $N\sub{init} = 50000$ and $N\sub{main} = 450000$.

We initially aimed for an acceptance rate of $0.234$; this is optimal for a random walk Metropolis algorithm with some specific high-dimensional target distributions \citep{Roberts1997,Roberts2001}. In many cases we found better convergence when aiming for a lower acceptance rate, say $0.1$. This is not unexpected: the optimal rate may be lower than $0.234$ when the parameters are not independent and identically distributed \citep{Bedard2007, Bedard2008, Bedard2008a}. In practice, the final acceptance rate is (almost always) lower than the target rate as the use of a multivariate Gaussian for the proposal distribution is rarely a good fit at the edges of the posterior. Consequently, the precise choice for the target acceptance rate is unimportant as long as it is of the correct magnitude. Final rates are typically within a factor of $2$ of the target value. As an initial choice, we set $s = 2.38^2/d$, which is the optimal choice if $\boldsymbol{C}$ was the true target covariance for a high dimensional target of independent and identically distributed parameters \citep{Gelman1996,Roberts1997,Roberts2001,Haario2001}.\footnote{Reasonably good results may be obtained by fixing $s$ at this value, and not adjusting to fine tune the acceptance rate.}

To assess the convergence of the MCMC we check the trace plot (the parameters' values throughout the run) for proper mixing, that the one and two dimensional posterior plots fill out to a smooth distribution, and that the distribution widths tend towards consistent values.

\section{Results}\label{sec:Results}

\subsection{Data set}

To investigate the information contained in EMRBs, we again considered a range of orbits. The MBH was assumed to have the standard mass and position. The CO was chosen to be $10 M_\odot$, as the most promising candidates for EMRBs would be BHs: they are massive and hence produce higher SNR bursts, they are more likely to be on close orbits as a consequence of mass segregation \citep{Bahcall1977, Alexander2009}, and they cannot be tidally disrupted.

Orbits were chosen with periapses uniformly distributed in logarithmic space between the the inner-most orbit and $16 r\sub{g}$. The other parameters were chosen randomly from appropriate uniform distributions. 

The results of the MCMC runs show strong and complex parameter dependencies. Some example results are shown in \figref{MCMC-1}, \ref{fig:MCMC-2} and \ref{fig:MCMC-3}.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{./images/Fig_MCMC_327_triangle_40}
\caption{Marginalised one and two dimensional posteriors. The scales are identical in both sets of plots. The dotted line indicates the true value. These distributions are fairly cromulent and well converged. Angular momentum is in units of $L_\bullet = GM_\bullet c^{-1}$. The input orbit has $r\sub{p} \simeq 8.54 r\sub{g}$ and $\rho \simeq 916$.\label{fig:MCMC-1}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The first is well-behaved. It is almost Gaussian, but we see some asymmetries and imperfections. There are also strong degeneracies, indicated by needle-like distributions. This is a fairly standard example: there are runs which are closer to being Gaussian (especially at higher SNR), and equally there are tighter correlations. The lenticular $M_\bullet$--$L_\infty$ degeneracy is common.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{./images/Fig_MCMC_53_triangle_40}
\caption{Marginalised one and two dimensional posteriors. The scales are identical in both sets of plots. The dotted line indicates the true value. These distributions show definite non-gaussianity. The input orbit has $r\sub{p} \simeq 9.86 r\sub{g}$ and $\rho \simeq 1790$.\label{fig:MCMC-2}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The second shows banana-like degeneracies. These are not uncommon; there are varying degrees of curvature. The more complicated shape makes it harder for the MCMC to converge, so the final distribution is not as smooth as for the first example. The curving degeneracies also bias the one dimensional marginalisations away from the true values.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{./images/Fig_MCMC_181_triangle_40}
\caption{Marginalised one and two dimensional posteriors. The scales are identical in both sets of plots. The dotted line indicates the true value. These distributions show complicated degeneracies. The input orbit has $r\sub{p} \simeq 11.60 r\sub{g}$ and $\rho \simeq 590$.}
\label{fig:MCMC-3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The third shows more intricate behaviour. This is more rare, but indicates the variety of shapes that is obtainable. Again the convergence is more difficult, so the distributions are rougher around the edges; there is also some biasing due to the curving degeneracies.

Our results do not incorporate any priors (save to keep them within realistic ranges); we have not folded in the existing information we have, for example, about the MBH's mass. Therefore, the resulting distributions characterise what we could learn from EMRBs alone. By the time a space-borne GW detector finally flies, we will have much better constraints on some parameters.

It is possible to place good constraints from the closest orbits. These can provide sufficient information to give beautifully behaved posteriors although significant correlation between parameters persists.

\subsection{Distribution widths}

Characteristic distribution widths are shown in \figref{sigmas}. Plotted are the standard deviation $\sigma\sub{SD}$; a scaled $50$-percentile range $\sigma_{50} = W_{50}/1.34898$, where $W_{50}$ is the range that contains the median $50\%$ of points, and a scaled $95$-percentile range $\sigma_{95} = W_{95}/3.919928$, where $W_{95}$ is the $95\%$ range. These widths are equal for a normal distribution. Filled circles are used for runs that appear to have converged. Open circles are for those yet to converge, but which appear to be approaching an equilibrium state; widths should be accurate to within a factor of a few.

For guidance, the dotted line corresponds to the current measurement uncertainty for $M_\bullet$; the dashed lines are from uniform priors for $a_\ast$, $\Phi\sub{K}$, $\phi\sub{p}$, $\chi\sub{p}$, $\cos\Theta\sub{K}$ and $\cos\iota$, and, for completeness, the solid line indicates the total prior range. We have no expectations for the width of the MBH mass distribution with respect to the current value; however, we would expect that the recovered distributions for the other parameters are narrower than for the case of complete ignorance. This may not be the case if the distribution is multimodal: in this event using the width is an inadequate description of the distribution. Only a few unconverged runs exceed these limits, and some appear to be multimodal.

The widths show a trend of decreasing with decreasing periapsis or increasing SNR, but there is a large degree of scatter. There does not appear to be a strong dependence upon any single input parameter, with the exception of the spin. The widths for $\iota$, $\Theta\sub{K}$, $\Phi\sub{K}$, $\phi\sub{p}$ and $\chi\sub{p}$ increase for smaller spin magnitudes. The dependence is shown in \figref{sigmas-spin}.

These parameters are defined with reference to the coordinate system established by the spin axis: for $a_\ast = 0$ we have spherical symmetry and there would be ambiguity in defining them. Therefore, it makes sense that they can be more accurately determined for larger spin magnitudes. The width for $a_\ast$, however, shows no clear correlation.

\subsection{Scientific potential}

Having quantified the precision with which we could infer parameters from an EMRB waveform, we can now consider if it is possible to learn anything new.

Of paramount interest are the MBH mass and spin. The current uncertainty in the mass is $\sigma_{M_\bullet} = 0.36 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ ($\sim 8\%$; \citealt{Gillessen2009}). There are few runs amongst our data set that are not better than this: it appears that orbits of a $\mu = 10 M_\odot$ CO with periapses $r\sub{p} \lesssim 13 r\sub{g}$ should be able to match our current observational constraints. However, the EMRB is an independent measurement, and so a measurement of comparable precision to the current bound can still be informative. Accuracy of $1\%$ could be possible if $r\sub{p} \lesssim 8 r\sub{g}$.

The spin is less well constrained. To obtain an uncertainty for the magnitude of $0.1$, comparable to that achieved in X-ray measurements of active galactic nuclei, it appears that the periapsis needs to be $r\sub{p} \lesssim 11 r\sub{g}$. For smaller periapses, the uncertainty can be much less, indicating that an EMRB could be an excellent probe. The orientation angles for the spin axis may be constrained to better than $0.1$ for $r\sub{p} \lesssim 11 r\sub{g}$. It may well be possible to learn both the direction and the magnitude of the spin. This could illuminate the MBH's formation.

We have no {\it a priori} knowledge about the CO or its orbit, so anything we learn would be new. However, this is not particularly useful information, unless we observe multiple bursts, and can start to build up statistics for the dynamics of the GC. Using current observations for the distance to the GC, which could be further improved by the mass measurement from the EMRB, it is possible to infer a value for the mass $\mu$ from $\zeta$. This could inform us of the nature of the object (BH, NS or WD) and be a useful consistency check. A small value of $\zeta$, indicating a massive CO, would be unambiguous evidence for the existence of a stellar mass black hole.
