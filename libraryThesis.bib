abstract = {If the gravitational field of a massive, compact body is stationary, axially symmetric, and reflection symmetric across the equatorial plane, and if a much less massive compact object (such as a neutron star or a small black hole) were to orbit in a circle on the equatorial plane of the central, compact body, then the produced gravitational waves would carry the values of the central body’s multipole moments. By detecting those waves and extracting from them the central body’s lowest few moments, gravitational-wave detectors have the potential to test the black-hole no-hair theorem and search for exotic objects such as naked singularities and boson or soliton stars. This paper estimates how accurately we can expect to measure the central body’s moments. The measurement errors are estimated using a combination of, first, the leading-order (of a post-Newtonian series) contribution of each moment to the gravitational-wave phase, second, an a priori probability distribution that constrains each moment’s magnitude to a range appropriate for a compact body, and third, any relations that the multipole moments satisfy among themselves, which reduce the number of degrees of freedom for the waves (this is useful in cases when one is searching for a specific type of compact body). We find that the Earth-based LIGO detector cannot provide sufficiently precise measurements of enough multipole moments to search for exotic objects, but the space-based LISA detector can do so.},

@article{Mancini2011,
abstract = {Thanks to the angular resolution of modern telescopes and kinematic models, the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the inner part of galaxies has been established on quite solid grounds. A possible correlation between the mass of SMBHs and the evolutionary state of their host galaxies is expected. Based on the recent 2D decomposition of mid-infrared Spiter/IRAC images of local galaxies with M_bh measurements, we investigated various scaling laws, studying what the best predictor of the mass of the central SMBHs is. We focused on the M_bh-M_G sigma^2 law, the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the kinetic energy of random motions of the corresponding host galaxies. In order to find the best fit for each of the scaling laws examined, we performed a least-squares regression of M_bh on x for the considered sample of galaxies, x being a whatever known parameter of the galaxy bulge. Our analysis shows that M_bh-M_G sigma^2 law fits the examined experimental data successfully as much as the other known scaling laws and shows a value of chi^2 better than the others, a result which is consistent with previous determinations. This means that a combination of sigma and M_G could be necessary to drive the correlations between M_bh and other bulge properties. This issue has been investigated by a careful analysis of the residuals of the various relations. In order to avoid rushed conclusions on galaxy activity and evolution, the indirect inferring of M_bh from the kinetic energy of random motions should be considered, especially when applied to higher redshift galaxies. This statement is suggested by a reanalysis of the SDSS data used to study the SMBH growth in the nearby Universe. Adopting the M_bh-M_G sigma^2 relation instead of the M_bh-sigma, a radio-quiet/radio-loud dichotomy appears in the SMBH mass distribution of the corresponding SDSS early-type AGN galaxies.},

The data suggest that jet power scales either as the square of a* or the square of the angular velocity of the horizon. This is the first direct evidence that jets may be powered by black hole spin energy. The observed correlation validates the continuum-fitting method of measuring spin. In addition, for those black holes that have well-sampled radio observations of ballistic jets, the correlation may be used to obtain rough estimates of their spins.},

@article{Daly2013,
abstract = {Supermassive black holes may be described by their mass and spin. When supermassive black holes are active, the activity provides a probe of the state of the black hole system. The spin of a hole can be estimated when the black hole mass and beam power of the source are known for sources with powerful outflows. Seventy-five sources for which both the black hole mass and beam power could be obtained are identified and used to obtain estimates of black hole spins. The 75 supermassive black holes studied include 52 FRII radio galaxies and 23 FRII radio loud quasars with redshifts ranging from about zero to two. The new values are combined with those obtained previously for 19 FRII radio galaxies, 7 FRII radio loud quasars, and 29 radio sources associated with CD galaxies to form samples of 71 FRII radio galaxies, 30 FRII quasars, and a total sample of 130 spin values; all of the sources are associated with massive elliptical galaxies. The new values obtained are similar to those obtained earlier at similar redshift, and range from about 0.1 to 1 for FRII sources. The overall results are consistent with those obtained previously: the spins tend to decrease with decreasing redshift for the FRII sources studied. There is a hint that the range of values of black hole spin at a given redshift is larger for FRII quasars than for FRII radio galaxies. There is no indication of a strong correlation between supermassive black hole mass and spin for the supermassive black holes studied here. The relation between beam power and black hole mass is obtained and used as a diagnostic of the outflows and the dependence of the magnetic field strength on black hole mass.},

abstract = {We introduce a new kludge scheme to model the dynamics of generic extreme mass-ratio inspirals (stellar compact objects spiraling into a spinning supermassive black hole) and to produce the gravitational waveforms that describe the gravitational-wave emission of these systems. This scheme combines tools from different techniques in General Relativity: It uses a multipolar, post-Minkowskian (MPM) expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (which provides the gravitational waveforms, here taken up to mass hexadecapole and current octopole order) and for the local prescription of the self-force (since we are lacking a general prescription for it); a post-Newtonian expansion for the computation of the multipole moments in terms of the trajectories; and a BH perturbation theory expansion when treating the trajectories as a sequence of self-adjusting Kerr geodesics. The orbital evolution is thus equivalent to solving the geodesic equations with time-dependent orbital elements, as dictated by the MPM radiation-reaction prescription. To complete the scheme, both the orbital evolution and wave generation require to map the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates of the orbits to the harmonic coordinates in which the different MPM quantities have been derived, a mapping that we provide explicitly in this paper. This new kludge scheme is thus a combination of approximations that can be used to model generic inspirals of systems with extreme mass ratios to systems with more moderate mass ratios, and hence can provide valuable information for future space-based gravitational-wave observatories like LISA and even for advanced ground detectors. Finally, due to the local character in time of our MPM self-force, this scheme can be used to perform studies of the possible appearance of transient resonances in generic inspirals.},

@article{Gerosa2014a,
abstract = {We investigate the consequences of superkicks on the population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the Universe residing in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). BCGs are the most massive galaxies in the Universe, sitting at the center of galaxy clusters. There is strong observational evidence that they grew prominently at late times (up to a factor 2-4 in mass from z=1), mainly through mergers with satellite galaxies from the cluster, and they host the most massive SMBHs ever observed, with masses up to ten billion solar masses. Those SMBHs are also expected to grow hierarchically, together with their host galaxies, experiencing a series of mergers with other SMBHs brought in by merging satellites. Because of the asymmetric gravitational wave emission, some net linear momentum is emitted during the last stages of the binary inspiral and the remnant SMBH experiences a kick in the opposite direction. Kicks may be as large as $\sim$5000 Km/s ("superkicks"), pushing the SMBHs out in the cluster outskirts for a time comparable to galaxy-evolution timescales. Therefore, measurements of the SMBH occupation fraction can be used to observationally test the existence of superkicks in nature. Because of their violent merger history, BCGs are the ideal objects to explore this possibility. Series of (super)kicks are expected to take place, increasing the total ejection probability. Moreover, BCGs host the SMBHs with the largest sphere of influence on the surrounding stars, which makes them the easiest targets for SMBH mass measurements. We predict, under a number of plausible assumptions, that superkicks can efficiently eject SMBHs from BCGs, bringing their occupation fraction down to a likely range 0.9<f<0.99 in the local Universe. A single observational confirmation of a missing nuclear SMBH would provide strong evidence for the occurrence of superkicks in the strong-gravity regime of BH mergers.},

abstract = {We have performed hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic rotational supernova core collapse in axisymmetry and have computed the gravitational radiation emitted by such an event. The Einstein equations are formulated using the conformally flat metric approximation, and the corresponding hydrodynamic equations are written as a first-order flux-conservative hyperbolic system. Details of the methodology and of the numerical code have been given in an accompanying paper. We have simulated the evolution of 26 models in both Newtonian and relativistic gravity. The initial configurations are differentially rotating relativistic 4 / 3 -polytropes in equilibrium which have a central density of 1010 g cm-3. Collapse is initiated by decreasing the adiabatic index to some prescribed fixed value. The equation of state consists of a polytropic and a thermal part for a more realistic treatment of shock waves. Any microphysics like electron capture and neutrino transport is neglected. Our simulations show that the three different types of rotational supernova core collapse and gravitational waveforms identified in previous Newtonian simulations (regular collapse, multiple bounce collapse, and rapid collapse) are also present in relativistic gravity. However, rotational core collapse with multiple bounces is only possible in a much narrower parameter range in relativistic gravity. The relativistic models cover almost the same range of gravitational wave amplitudes ( 4 x 10-21 <=h{TT} <=3 x 10-20 for a source at a distance of 10 kpc) and frequencies ( 60 Hz <=nu <=1000 Hz ) as the corresponding Newtonian ones. Averaged over all models, the total energy radiated in the form of gravitational waves is 8.2 x 10-8 Msun c2 in the relativistic case, and 3.6 x 10-8 Msun c2 in the Newtonian case. For all collapse models that are of the same type in both Newtonian and relativistic gravity, the gravitational wave signal is of lower amplitude. If the collapse type changes, either weaker or stronger signals are found in the relativistic case. For a given model, relativistic gravity can cause a large increase of the characteristic signal frequency of up to a factor of five, which may have important consequences for the signal detection. Our study implies that the prospects for detection of gravitational wave signals from axisymmetric supernova rotational core collapse do not improve when taking into account relativistic gravity. The gravitational wave signals obtained in our study are within the sensitivity range of the first generation laser interferometer detectors if the source is located within the Local Group. An online catalogue containing the gravitational wave signal amplitudes and spectra of all our models is available at the URL http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Hydro/hydro.html.},

The pseudo-bulges follow their own relations, they harbor an order of magnitude smaller black holes than those in the same massive classical bulges, i.e. M_bh$\sim$0.0003M_s or 0.0002M_d. Besides the M_bh-\sigma (bulge stellar velocity dispersion) relation, these bulge type dependent M_bh-M_bul scaling relations provide information for the growth and coevolution histories of SMBHs and their host bulges.

abstract = {Merging compact binaries are currently regarded as the most promising source of gravitational waves for the planned Earth-based LIGO/VIRGO laser-interferometer detector system, and will be an important source also for similar, lower-frequency detectors that might be flown in space (e.g., the proposed LISA mission). During the orbital inspiral, if one or both bodies are rapidly rotating, the general relativistic spin-orbit and spin-spin coupling (i.e., the "dragging of inertial frames" by the bodies' spins) cause the binary's orbital plane to precess. In this paper we analyze the resulting modulation of the inspiral gravitational waveform, using post2-Newtonian equations to describe the precession of the orbital plane, but only the leading-order (Newtonian, quadrupole-moment approximation) equations to describe the orbit, the radiation reaction, the inspiral, and the wave generation. We derive all the formulas one needs to readily compute the spin-modulated gravitational waveform (within the post-Newtonian approximation and the approximation that the precession frequency is much smaller than the orbital frequency). We also develop intuition into what the modulated signals "look like," by a variety of means. We provide approximate, analytical solutions for the precessional motion and the modulated waveforms for two important special cases: the case where the bodies have nearly equal masses and the case where one of the bodies has negligible spin. For these cases, for almost all choices of binary parameters, the motion is a simple precession of the orbital angular momentum around the nearly fixed direction of the total angular momentum, with a few tens of precession periods as the waves sweep through the LIGO/VIRGO observational band. However, when the spin and orbital angular momenta are approximately anti-aligned, there is a transitional-precession epoch during which their near cancellation causes the binary to "lose its gyroscopic bearings" and tumble in space, with a corresponding peculiar sweep of the waveform modulation. We also explore numerically the precessional behaviors that occur for general masses and spins; these typically appear quite similar to our special-case, simple-precession, and transitional-precession solutions. An Appendix develops several diagrammatic aids for understanding intuitively the relation between the precessing orbit and the modulated waveform.},

 particular, their diameters, absolute magnitudes, morphological types, circumnuclear region types,
 optical and H I surface brightnesses, rotational velocities, and indicative mass-to-luminosity and H
 I mass-to-luminosity ratios, as well as a so-called tidal index, which quantifies the galaxy
 environment. We expect the catalog completeness to be roughly 70%–80% within 8 Mpc. About 85% of the
 Local Volume population are dwarf (dIr, dIm, and dSph) galaxies with M B > -17.0, which contribute
 about 4% to the local luminosity density, and roughly 10%–15% to the local H I mass density. The H I
 mass-to-luminosity and the H I mass-to-total (indicative) mass ratios increase systematically from
 giant galaxies toward dwarfs, reaching maximum values about 5 in solar units for the most tiny
 objects. For the Local Volume disklike galaxies, their H I masses and angular momentum follow
 Zasov's linear relation, expected for rotating gaseous disks being near the threshold of
 gravitational instability, favorable for active star formation. We found that the mean local
 luminosity density exceeds 1.7–2.0 times the global density, in spite of the presence of the Tully
 void and the absence of rich clusters in the Local Volume. The mean local H I density is 1.4 times
 its "global" value derived from the H I Parkes Sky Survey. However, the mean local baryon density $\Omega$
 b (< 8 Mpc) = 2.3% consists of only a half of the global baryon density, $\Omega$ b = (4.7 ± 0.6)% (Spergel
 et al., published in 2003). The mean-square pairwise difference of radial velocities is about 100 km
 s -1 for spatial separations within 1 Mpc, increasing to $\sim$300 km s -1 on a scale of $\sim$3 Mpc. also We
 calculated the integral area of the sky occupied by the neighboring galaxies. Assuming the H I size
 of spiral and irregular galaxies to be 2.5 times their standard optical diameter and ignoring any
 evolution effect, we obtain the expected number of the line-of-sight intersections with the H I
 galaxy images to be dn / dz $\sim$ 0.4, which does not contradict the observed number of absorptions in
 QSO spectra.},

abstract = {If binary black holes form following the successive core collapses of sufficiently massive binary stars, precessional dynamics may align their spins $\mathbf S_1$ and $\mathbf S_2$ and the orbital angular momentum $\mathbf L$ into a plane in which they jointly precess about the total angular momentum $\mathbf J$. These spin orientations are known as spin-orbit resonances since $\mathbf S_1$, $\mathbf S_2$, and $\mathbf L$ all precess at the same frequency to maintain their planar configuration. Two families of such spin-orbit resonances exist, alike in dignity but differentiated by whether the components of the two spins in the orbital plane are either aligned or antialigned. The fraction of binary black holes in each family is determined by the stellar evolution of their progenitors, so if gravitational-wave detectors could measure this fraction they could provide important insights into astrophysical formation scenarios for binary black holes. In this paper, we show that even under the conservative assumption that binary black holes are observed along the direction of $\mathbf J$ (where precession-induced modulations to the gravitational waveforms are minimized), the waveforms of many members of each resonant family can be distinguished from all members of the opposing family in events with signal-to-noise ratios $\rho \simeq 10$, typical of those expected for the first detections with Advanced LIGO/Virgo. We hope that our preliminary findings inspire a greater appreciation of the capability of gravitational-wave detectors to constrain stellar astrophysics and stimulate further studies of the distinguishability of spin-orbit resonant families in more expanded regions of binary black-hole parameter space.},

abstract = {Black-hole binary coalescences are one of the most promising sources for the first detection of gravitational waves. Fast and accurate theoretical models of the gravitational radiation emitted from these coalescences are highly important for the detection and extraction of physical parameters. Spinning effective-one-body (EOB) models for binaries with aligned spins have been shown to be highly faithful, but are slow to generate and thus have not yet been used for parameter estimation studies. I provide a frequency-domain singular value decomposition (SVD)-based surrogate reduced order model that is thousands to hundred thousands times faster for typical system masses and has a faithfulness mismatch of better than $\sim 0.1\%$ with the original SEOBNRv1 model for advanced LIGO detectors. This model enables parameter estimation studies up to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 20 and even up to SNR 50 for masses below $50 M_\odot$. This article discusses various choices for approximations and interpolation over the parameter space that can be made for reduced order models of spinning BH binaries, provides a detailed discussion of errors arising in the construction and assesses the fidelity of such models.},

abstract = {Very long baseline interferometric observations have resolved structure on scales of only a few Schwarzschild radii around the supermassive black holes at the centers of our Galaxy and M87. In the near future, such observations are expected to image the shadows of these black holes together with a bright and narrow ring surrounding their shadows. For a Kerr black hole, the shape of this photon ring is nearly circular unless the black hole spins very rapidly. Whether or not, however, astrophysical black holes are truly described by the Kerr metric as encapsulated in the no-hair theorem still remains an untested assumption. For black holes that differ from Kerr black holes, photon rings have been shown numerically to be asymmetric for small to intermediate spins. In this paper, I calculate semi-analytic expressions of the shapes of photon rings around black holes described by a new Kerr-like metric which is valid for all spins. I show that photon rings in this spacetime are affected by two types of deviations from the Kerr metric which can cause the ring shape to be highly asymmetric. I argue that the ring asymmetry is a direct measure of a potential violation of the no-hair theorem and that both types of deviations can be detected independently if the mass and distance of the black hole are known. In addition, I obtain approximate expressions of the diameters, displacements, and asymmetries of photon rings around Kerr and Kerr-like black holes.},

@article{Breen2013,
abstract = {Recent observational evidence, numerical simulations and theoretical arguments seem to indicate that stellar mass black holes (BH) persist in stellar systems such as globular star clusters for much longer than previously thought. Previously, theory implied that the BH would segregate into a compact system with short dynamical time scales, and that the BH would escape long before the present. But stellar systems can exist in a state of balanced evolution, where the energy generated in the core is regulated by the process of two-body relaxation in the bulk of the system. If the system has a centrally concentrated BH subsystem and there is no massive central BH, then the energy is generated by three-body encounters in the core of this subsystem. Therefore, in balanced evolution, the evolution of the BH subsystem is regulated by the much longer time scales of the host system. In the present paper the implications of these results for idealized nuclear star clusters (NSC) are discussed. Though previous theory implied that BH would be almost absent from many NSC -- those with relatively short dynamical time scales -- it is argued here that, based on the results of idealized models, many such NSC could still be host to substantial BH subsystems.},

abstract = {Precessing black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries produce a rich gravitational wave signal, encoding the binary's nature and inspiral kinematics. Using the lalinference\_mcmc Markov-chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation code, we use two fiducial examples to illustrate how the geometry and kinematics are encoded into the modulated gravitational wave signal, using coordinates well-adapted to precession. Even for precessing binaries, we show the performance of detailed parameter estimation can be estimated by "effective" estimates: comparisons of a prototype signal with its nearest neighbors, adopting a fixed sky location and idealized two-detector network. We use detailed and effective approaches to show higher harmonics provide nonzero but small local improvement when estimating the parameters of precessing BH-NS binaries. That said, we show higher harmonics can improve parameter estimation accuracy for precessing binaries ruling out approximately-degenerate source orientations.   Our work illustrates quantities gravitational wave measurements can provide, such as reliable component masses and the precise orientation of a precessing short gamma ray burst progenitor relative to the line of sight. "Effective" estimates may provide a simple way to estimate trends in the performance of parameter estimation for generic precessing BH-NS binaries in next-generation detectors. For example, our results suggest that the orbital chirp rate, precession rate, and precession geometry are roughly-independent observables, defining natural variables to organize correlations in the high-dimensional BH-NS binary parameter space.},

This choice is motivated by the fact that, basically, we do not know the position in the sky of the spin axis of the SBH in Sgr A* with sufficient accuracy. We apply our results to S2, which is the closest star discovered so far having an orbital period P_b = 15.98 yr, and to a hypothetical closer star X with P_b = 0.5 yr.

abstract = {We analyze deep near-IR adaptive optics imaging (taken with NAOS/CONICA on the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory, Chile), as well as new proper-motion data of the nuclear star cluster of the Milky Way. The surface density distribution of faint ( H ≤ 20, K s ≤ 19) stars peaks within 0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 2 of the black hole candidate Sgr A*. The radial density distribution of this stellar "cusp" follows a power law of exponent $\alpha$ $\sim$ 1.3-1.4. The K -band luminosity function of the overall nuclear stellar cluster (within 9'' of Sgr A*) resembles that of the large-scale Galactic bulge but shows an excess of stars at K s ≤ 14. It fits population synthesis models of an old, metal-rich stellar population with a contribution from young, early, and late-type stars at the bright end. In contrast, the cusp within ≤1 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 5 of Sgr A* appears to have a featureless luminosity function, suggesting that old, low-mass, horizontal-branch/red-clump stars are lacking. Likewise, there appear to be fewer late-type giants. The innermost cusp also contains a group of moderately bright, early-type stars that are tightly bound to the black hole. We interpret these results as evidence that the stellar properties change significantly from the outer cluster (≥a few arcseconds) to the dense innermost region around the black hole. We find that most of the massive early-type stars at distances of 1''-10'' from Sgr A* are located in two rotating and geometrically thin disks. These disks are inclined at large angles and counterrotate with respect to each other. Their stellar content is essentially the same, indicating that they formed at the same time. We conclude that of the possible formation scenarios for these massive stars the most probable one is that 5-8 million years ago two clouds fell into the center, collided, were shock compressed, and then formed two rotating (accretion) disks orbiting the central black hole. For the OB stars in the central arcsecond, on the other hand, a stellar merger model is the most appealing explanation. These stars may thus be "super-blue stragglers," formed and "rejuvenated" through mergers of lower mass stars in the very dense (≥10 8 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} pc -3 ) environment of the cusp. The "collider model" also accounts for the lack of giants within the central few arcseconds. The star closest to Sgr A* in 2002, S2, exhibits a 3.8 $\mu$m excess. We propose that the mid-IR emission comes either from the accretion flow around the black hole itself or from dust in the accretion flow that is heated by the ultraviolet emission of S2.},

abstract = {We have examined the relationship between supermassive black hole mass (M_BH) and the stellar mass of the host spheroid (M_sph,*) for a sample of 75 nearby galaxies. To derive the spheroid stellar masses we used improved 2MASS K_s-band photometry from the ARCHANGEL photometry pipeline. Dividing our sample into core-S\'ersic and S\'ersic galaxies, we find that they are described by very different M_BH-M_sph,* relations. For core-S\'ersic galaxies - which are typically massive and luminous, with M_BH \gtrsim 2x10^8 M_solar - we find M_BH \propto M_sph,*^(0.97 \pm 0.14), consistent with other literature relations. However, for the S\'ersic galaxies - with typically lower masses, M_sph,* \lesssim 3x10^10 M_solar - we find M_BH \propto M_sph,*^(2.22 \pm 0.58), a dramatically steeper slope that differs by more than 2 standard deviations. This relation confirms that, for S\'ersic galaxies, M_BH is not a constant fraction of M_sph,*. S\'ersic galaxies can grow via the accretion of gas which fuels both star formation and the central black hole, as well as through merging. Their black hole grows significantly more rapidly than their host spheroid, prior to growth by dry merging events that produce core-S\'ersic galaxies, where the black hole and spheroid grow in lock step. We have additionally compared our S\'ersic M_BH-M_sph,* relation with the corresponding relation for nuclear star clusters, confirming that the two classes of central massive object follow significantly different scaling relations.},

abstract = {We consider whether stellar collisions can explain the observed depletion of red giants in the Galactic center. We model the stellar population with two different IMFs: 1) the Miller-Scalo and 2) a much flatter IMF. In the former case, low-mass main-sequence stars dominate the population, and collisions are unable to remove red giants out to 0.4 pc although brighter red giants much closer in may be depleted via collisions with stellar-mass black holes. For a much flatter IMF, the stellar population is dominated by compact remnants (i.e. black holes, white dwarfs and neutron stars). The most common collisions are then those between main-sequence stars and compact remnants. Such encounters are likely to destroy the main-sequence stars and thus prevent their evolution into red giants. In this way, the red-giant population could be depleted out to 0.4 pc matching observations. If this is the case, it implies the Galactic center contains a much larger population of stellar-mass black holes than would be expected from a regular IMF. This may in turn have implications for the formation and growth of the central supermassive black hole.},

@article{Broderick2010,
abstract = {Millimeter very-long baseline interferometry (mm-VLBI) provides the novel capacity to probe the emission region of a handful of supermassive black holes on sub-horizon scales. For Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, this provides access to the region in the immediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick et al. (2009) have already shown that by leveraging spectral and polarization information as well as accretion theory, it is possible to extract accretion-model parameters (including black hole spin) from mm-VLBI experiments containing only a handful of telescopes. Here we repeat this analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a class of aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We find that the combined data set rules out symmetric models for Sgr A*'s flux distribution at the 3.9-sigma level, strongly favoring length-to-width ratios of roughly 2.4:1. More importantly, we find that physically motivated accretion flow models provide a significantly better fit to the mm-VLBI observations than phenomenological models, at the 2.9-sigma level. This implies that not only is mm-VLBI presently capable of distinguishing between potential physical models for Sgr A*'s emission, but further that it is sensitive to the strong gravitational lensing associated with the propagation of photons near the black hole. Based upon this analysis we find that the most probable magnitude, viewing angle, and position angle for the black hole spin are a=0.0(+0.64+0.86), theta=68(+5+9)(-20-28) degrees, and xi=-52(+17+33)(-15-24) east of north, where the errors quoted are the 1-sigma and 2-sigma uncertainties.},

abstract = {Core-collapse supernovae are among the most energetic explosions in the universe marking the catastrophic end of massive stars. In spite of rigorous studies for several decades, we still do not understand the explosion mechanism completely. Since they are related to many astrophysical phenomena such as nucleosynthesis, gamma-ray bursts and acceleration of cosmic rays, understanding of their physics has been of wide interest to the astrophysical community. In this paper, we review recent progress in the study of core-collapse supernovae focusing on the explosion mechanism, supernova neutrinos and the gravitational waves. Regarding the explosion mechanism, we present a review paying particular attention to the roles of multidimensional aspects, such as convection, rotation and magnetic fields, on the neutrino heating mechanism. Next, we discuss supernova neutrino, which is a powerful tool to probe not only deep inside the supernovae but also the intrinsic properties of neutrinos. For this purpose, it is necessary to understand neutrino oscillation which has been established recently by many experiments. Gravitational astronomy is also now becoming a reality. We present an extensive review on the physical foundations and the emission mechanism of gravitational waves in detail and discuss the possibility of their detections.},

abstract = {The main goal of the LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission is to fully characterize the acceleration noise models and to test key technologies for future space-based gravitational-wave observatories similar to the LISA/eLISA concept. The Data Analysis (DA) team has developed complex three-dimensional models of the LISA Technology Package (LTP) experiment on-board LPF. These models are used for simulations, but more importantly, they will be used for parameter estimation purposes during flight operations. One of the tasks of the DA team is to identify the physical effects that contribute significantly to the properties of the instrument noise. A way of approaching to this problem is to recover the essential parameters of the LTP which describe the data. Thus, we want to define the simplest model that efficiently explains the observations. To do so, adopting a Bayesian framework, one has to estimate the so-called Bayes Factor between two competing models. In our analysis, we use three main different methods to estimate it: The Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the Schwarz criterion, and the Laplace approximation. They are applied first to toy models and then, they are verified with full LTP models, where we investigate the correlation of the output of these methods with the design of the experiment itself.},

Our analysis also reveals that gravitational waves in the modified theory travel at the speed of light in Minkowski spacetime. However, on a Schwarzschild background the characteristic speed of propagation along a given direction splits into two modes, one subluminal and one superluminal. The width of the splitting depends on the azimuthal components of the propagation vector, is linearly proportional to the mass of the black hole, and decreases with the third inverse power of the distance from the black hole. Radial propagation is unaffected, implying that as probed by gravitational waves the location of the event horizon of the spacetime is unaltered. The analysis further reveals that when a high frequency, pure gravitational wave is scattered from a black hole, a scalar wave of comparable amplitude is excited, and vice-versa.},

They are produced when a compact object passes through periapsis on a highly eccentric orbit about a much more massive object; we consider stellar mass objects orbiting the massive black holes (MBHs) found in galactic centres. Such a system may emit many EMRBs before eventually completing the inspiral. There are several nearby galaxies that could yield detectable bursts. For a space-borne interferometer like LISA, sensitivity is greatest for EMRBs from MBHs of $\sim$10^6-10^7 solar masses, which could be detected out to $\sim$100 Mpc. Considering the examples of M32, NGC 4945 and NGC 4395 we investigate if extragalactic EMRB signals can provide information about their sources. This is possible, but only if the periapse radius of the orbit is small, of order r_p < 8 r_g, where r_g = GM/c^2 is the gravitational radius of the MBH. This limits the utility of EMRBs as an astronomical tool. However, if we are lucky, we could place constraints on the mass and spin of nearby MBHs with 1% precision.},

abstract = {An analysis of general scalar-tensor gravitation theory, containing two arbitrary functions of the scalar field, is presented. The weak-field limit is considered in detail, and predictions for the classical tests of gravitation theory are derived. A definite relationship between the light propagation and perihelion shift effects is found to hold under very general conditions. The theory of the detection of gravitational waves is also investigated, and the observable differences between the scalar and tensor components are indicated. Finally, the relationship between the properties of the source and its radiation is considered in the weak-source limit, and expressions for the rate of energy loss are derived. It is shown that the existing observational data are consistent with the possibility that the scalar field represents a major component of gravitational radiation from astronomical sources.},

abstract = {The late inspiral, merger, and ringdown of a black hole-neutron star (BHNS) system can provide information about the neutron-star equation of state (EOS). Candidate EOSs can be approximated by a parametrized piecewise-polytropic EOS above nuclear density, matched to a fixed low-density EOS; and we report results from a large set of BHNS inspiral simulations that systematically vary two parameters. To within the accuracy of the simulations, we find that, apart from the neutron-star mass, a single physical parameter Lambda, describing its deformability, can be extracted from the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown waveform. This parameter is related to the radius, mass, and l=2 Love number, k_2, of the neutron star by Lambda = 2k_2 R^5/3M_{NS}^5, and it is the same parameter that determines the departure from point-particle dynamics during the early inspiral. Observations of gravitational waves from BHNS inspiral thus restrict the EOS to a surface of constant Lambda in the parameter space, thickened by the measurement error. Using various configurations of a single Advanced LIGO detector, we find that neutron stars are distinguishable from black holes of the same mass and that Lambda^{1/5} or equivalently R can be extracted to 10-40% accuracy from single events for mass ratios of Q=2 and 3 at a distance of 100 Mpc, while with the proposed Einstein Telescope, EOS parameters can be extracted to accuracy an order of magnitude better.},

abstract = {The excitation of solar and solar-like g-modes in non-relativistic stars by arbitrary external gravitational wave fields is studied starting from the full field equations of general relativity. We develop a formalism that yields the mean-square amplitudes and surface velocities of global normal modes excited in such a way. The isotropic elastic sphere model of a star is adopted to demonstrate this formalism and for calculative simplicity. It is shown that gravitational waves solely couple to quadrupolar spheroidal eigenmodes and that normal modes are only sensitive to the spherical component of the gravitational waves having the same azimuthal order. The mean-square amplitudes in case of stationary external gravitational waves are given by a simple expression, a product of a factor depending on the resonant properties of the star and the power spectral density of the gravitational waves' spherical accelerations. Both mean-square amplitudes and surface velocities show a characteristic R^8-dependence (effective R^2-dependence) on the radius of the star. This finding increases the relevance of this excitation mechanism in case of stars larger than the Sun.},

abstract = {Today we believe that a typical galaxy contains about $10^7$ stellar-mass black holes and a single super-massive black hole at its center. According to general relativity, these objects are characterized solely by their mass $M$ and by their spin parameter $a_*$. A fundamental limit for a black hole in general relativity is the Kerr bound $|a_*| \le 1$, but the accretion process can spin it up to $a_* \approx 0.998$. If a compact object is not a black hole, the Kerr bound does not hold and in this letter I show that the accretion process can spin the body up to $a_* > 1$. While this fact should be negligible for stellar-mass objects, most of the super-massive objects at the center of galaxies may actually be super-spinning bodies exceeding the Kerr bound. Such a possibility can be tested by gravitational wave detectors like LISA or by sub-millimeter very long baseline interferometry facilities.},

In the millihertz frequency band, the predominate foreground signal will be from unresolved white dwarf binaries in the galaxy. We build on our previous work to show that a stochastic gravitational wave background can be detected in the presence of both instrument noise and a galactic confusion foreground. The key to our approach is accurately modeling the spectra for each of the various signal components. We simulate data for a gigameter Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) operating in the mHz frequency band detector operating with both 6- and 4-links. We obtain posterior distribution functions for the instrument noise parameters, the galaxy level and modulation parameters, and the stochastic background energy density. We find that we are able to detect a scale-invariant stochastic background with energy density as low as Omega_gw= 3e-15 for a 6-link interferometer and Omega_gw = 2e-13 for a 4-link interferometer.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We propose a solution to the problem of quickly and accurately predicting gravitational waveforms within any given physical model. The method is relevant for both real-time applications and in more traditional scenarios where the generation of waveforms using standard methods can be prohibitively expensive. Our approach is based on three offline steps resulting in an accurate reduced-order model that can be used as a surrogate for the true/fiducial waveform family. First, a set of m parameter values is determined using a greedy algorithm from which a reduced basis representation is constructed. Second, these m parameters induce the selection of m time values for interpolating a waveform time series using an empirical interpolant. Third, a fit in the parameter dimension is performed for the waveform's value at each of these m times. The cost of predicting L waveform time samples for a generic parameter choice is of order m L + m c_f online operations where c_f denotes the fitting function operation count and, typically, m << L. We generate accurate surrogate models for Effective One Body (EOB) waveforms of non-spinning binary black hole coalescences with durations as long as 10^5 M, mass ratios from 1 to 10, and for multiple harmonic modes. We find that these surrogates are three orders of magnitude faster to evaluate as compared to the cost of generating EOB waveforms in standard ways. Surrogate model building for other waveform models follow the same steps and have the same low online scaling cost. For expensive numerical simulations of binary black hole coalescences we thus anticipate large speedups in generating new waveforms with a surrogate. As waveform generation is one of the dominant costs in parameter estimation algorithms and parameter space exploration, surrogate models offer a new and practical way to dramatically accelerate such studies without impacting accuracy.},

abstract = {Identifying the source parameters from a gravitational-wave measurement alone is limited by our ability to discriminate signals from different sources and the accuracy of the waveform family employed in the search. Here we address both issues in the framework of an adapted coordinate system that allows for linear Fisher-matrix type calculations of waveform differences that are both accurate and computationally very efficient. We investigate statistical errors by using principal component analysis of the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion coefficients, which is well conditioned despite the Fisher matrix becoming ill-conditioned for larger numbers of parameters. We identify which combinations of physical parameters are most effectively measured by gravitational-wave detectors for systems of neutron stars and black holes with aligned spin. We confirm the expectation that the dominant parameter of the inspiral waveform is the chirp mass. The next dominant parameter depends on a combination of the spin and the symmetric mass ratio. In addition, we can study the systematic effect of various spin contributions to the PN phasing within the same parametrization, showing that the inclusion of spin-orbit corrections up to next-to-leading order, but not necessarily of spin-spin contributions, is crucial for an accurate inspiral waveform model. This understanding of the waveform structure throughout the parameter space is important to set up an efficient search strategy and correctly interpret future gravitational-wave observations.},

Specifically, the PPN parameter in the equivalent scalar-tensor theory is gamma=1/2, which is far outside the range allowed by observations. In response to a flurry of papers that questioned the equivalence of f(R) theory to scalar-tensor theories, it was recently shown explicitly, without resorting to the scalar-tensor equivalence, that the vacuum field equations for 1/R gravity around a spherically symmetric mass also yield gamma= 1/2. Here we generalize this analysis to f(R) gravity and enumerate the conditions that, when satisfied by the function f(R), lead to the prediction that gamma=1/2.},

LIGO/VIRGO can do moderate SNR (a few tens), moderate accuracy studies of BBH coalescences in the mass range of a few to about 2000 solar masses; LISA can do high SNR (of order 10^4) high accuracy studies in the mass range of about 10^5 to 10^8 solar masses. BBHs might well be the first sources detected by LIGO/VIRGO: they are visible to much larger distances (up to 500 Mpc by initial interferometers) than coalescing neutron star binaries (heretofore regarded as the "bread and butter" workhorse source for LIGO/VIRGO, visible to about 30 Mpc by initial interferometers). Low-mass BBHs (up to 50 solar masses for initial LIGO interferometers; 100 for advanced; 10^6 for LISA) are best searched for via their well-understood inspiral waves; higher mass BBHs must be searched for via their poorly understood merger waves and/or their well-understood ringdown waves. A matched filtering search for massive BBHs based on ringdown waves should be capable of finding BBHs in the mass range of about 100 to 700 solar masses out to 200 Mpc (initial LIGO interferometers), and 200 to 3000 solar masses out to about z=1 (advanced interferometers). The required number of templates is of order 6000 or less. Searches based on merger waves could increase the number of detected massive BBHs by a factor of order 10 or more over those found from inspiral and ringdown waves, without detailed knowledge of the waveform shapes, using a "noise monitoring" search algorithm. A full set of merger templates from numerical relativity could further increase the number of detected BBHs by an additional factor of up to 4.},

abstract = {In a previous article [Phys. Rev. D 82 104040 (2010)], we derived an energy-momentum tensor for linear gravity that exhibited positive energy density and causal energy flux. Here we extend this framework by localizing the angular momentum of the linearized gravitational field, deriving a gravitational spin tensor which possesses similarly desirable properties. By examining the local exchange of angular momentum (between matter and gravity) we find that gravitational intrinsic spin is localized, separately from orbital angular momentum, in terms of a gravitational spin tensor. This spin tensor is then uniquely determined by requiring that it obey two simple physically motivated algebraic conditions. Firstly, the spin of an arbitrary (harmonic-gauge) gravitational plane wave is required to flow in the direction of propagation of the wave. Secondly, the spin tensor of any transverse-traceless gravitational field is required to be traceless. (The second condition ensures that local field redefinitions suffice to cast our gravitational energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor as sources of gravity in a quadratic approximation to general relativity.) Additionally, the following properties arise in the spin tensor spontaneously: all transverse-traceless fields have purely spatial spin, and any field generated by a static distribution of matter will carry no spin at all. Following the structure of our previous paper, we then examine the (spatial) angular momentum exchanged between the gravitational field and an infinitesimal detector, and develop a microaveraging procedure that renders the process gauge-invariant. The exchange of nonspatial angular momentum (i.e., moment of energy) is also analyzed, leading us to conclude that a gravitational wave can displace the center of mass of the detector; this conclusion is also confirmed by a first principles treatment of the system.

@article{Carter1968,
abstract = {The Kerr family of solutions of the Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell equations is the most general class of solutions known at present which could represent the field of a rotating neutral or electrically charged body in asymptotically flat space. When the charge and specific angular momentum are small compared with the mass, the part of the manifold which is stationary in the strict sense is incomplete at a Killing horizon. Analytically extended manifolds are constructed in order to remove this incompleteness. Some general methods for the analysis of causal behavior are described and applied. It is shown that in all except the spherically symmetric cases there is nontrivial causality violation, i.e., there are closed timelike lines which are not removable by taking a covering space; moreover, when the charge or angular momentum is so large that there are no Killing horizons, this causality violation is of the most flagrant possible kind in that it is possible to connect any event to any other by a future-directed timelike line. Although the symmetries provide only three constants of the motion, a fourth one turns out to be obtainable from the unexpected separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, with the result that the equations, not only of geodesics but also of charged-particle orbits, can be integrated completely in terms of explicit quadratures. This makes it possible to prove that in the extended manifolds all geodesics which do not reach the central ring singularities are complete, and also that those timelike or null geodesics which do reach the singularities are entirely confined to the equator, with the further restriction, in the charged case, that they be null with a certain uniquely determined direction. The physical significance of these results is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {We present new techniqes for evolving binary black hole systems which allow the accurate determination of gravitational waveforms directly from the wave zone region of the numerical simulations. Rather than excising the black hole interiors, our approach follows the "puncture" treatment of black holes, but utilzing a new gauge condition which allows the black holes to move successfully through the computational domain. We apply these techniques to an inspiraling binary, modeling the radiation generated during the final plunge and ringdown. We demonstrate convergence of the waveforms and good conservation of mass-energy, with just over 3% of the system's mass converted to gravitional radiation.},

abstract = {We examine the formation of groups of multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in gas-poor galactic nuclei due to the high merger rate of galaxies at high redshifts. We calculate the relative likelihood of binary, triple, and quadruple SMBH systems, by considering the timescales for relevant processes and combining merger trees with N-body simulations for the dynamics of stars and SMBHs in galactic nuclei. Typical haloes today with mass $M_0\approx 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ have an average mass $M_{z=6}=5\times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ at $z\sim 6$, while rare haloes with current mass $M_0\gtrsim 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$ have an average mass $M_{z=6}=5\times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ at that redshift. These cluster-size haloes are expected to host single galaxies at $z\sim 6$. We expect about 30% galaxies within haloes with present-day mass $M_0\approx 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ to contain more than two SMBHs at redshifts $2\lesssim z\lesssim 6$. For larger present-day haloes, with $M_0\gtrsim 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$, this fraction is almost 60%. The existence of multiple SMBHs at high redshifts can potentially explain the mass deficiencies observed in the cores of massive elliptical galaxies, which are up to 5 times the mass of their central BHs. Multiple SMBHs would also lead to an enhanced rate of tidal disruption of stars, modified gravitational wave signals compared to isolated BH binaries, and slingshot ejection of SMBHs from galaxies at high speeds in excess of 2000 km s$^{-1}$.},

@article{Amaro-Seoane2012d,
abstract = {The capture of a compact object in a galactic nucleus by a massive black hole (MBH) is the best way to map space and time around it. It is well established that the event rate of stars kicked directly through the horizon (referred to as direct plunges) is much larger than the gradual inspiral due to the emission of gravitational waves. We prove that it is actually very difficult to get a compact object such a stellar black hole to be swallowed whole. A plunge will most likely be deflected into an EMRI orbit. They are simply very eccentric EMRIs and dominate the event rate. Moreover, if the central MBH is spinning, the net result on the rates is an enhancement, on both kinds of EMRIs. On the other hand, recent work on stellar dynamics has demonstrated that there seems to be a conspiracy in phase space, since rates decrease significantly by the presence of a blockade in the rate at which orbital angular momenta change takes place. This so-called "Schwarzschild barrier" is a result of the impact of relativistic precession on to the stellar potential torques and was first investigated by Merritt and collaborators. We confirm and quantify the existence of this barrier using a statistical sample of 2,500 direct-summation N-body simulations using both a post-Newtonian but also, and for the first time in a direct-summation integrator, a geodesic approximation for the relativistic orbits. Although the existence of the barrier prevents "traditional EMRIs" (i.e. EMRIs which are not very eccentric) from approaching the central MBH, very eccentric EMRIs, wrongly classified as plunges, insolently ignore the presence of the barrier. The combinations of these effects leads to the result that very eccentric orbits will dominate the rates.},

@article{Nandra2011,
abstract = {We present some astrophysical consequences of the metric for a point mass in an expanding universe derived in Nandra, Lasenby & Hobson, and of the associated invariant expression for the force required to keep a test particle at rest relative to the central mass. We focus on the effect of an expanding universe on galaxies and clusters. Using Newtonian and general-relativistic approaches, we identify two important time-dependent physical radii for such objects when the cosmological expansion is accelerating. The first radius, $r_F$, is that at which the total radial force on a test particle is zero, which is also the radius of the largest possible circular orbit about the central mass $m$ and where the gas pressure and its gradient vanish. The second radius, $r_S$, which is \approx r_F/1.6$, is that of the largest possible stable circular orbit, which we interpret as the theoretical maximum size for an object of mass $m$. In contrast, for a decelerating cosmological expansion, no such finite radii exist. Assuming a cosmological expansion consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM concordance model, at the present epoch we find that for clusters these radii are in good agreement with typical observed sizes. For galaxies, we find that these radii are much larger than typically quoted sizes, but agree closely with zeroes in the radial velocity field in the neighbourhood of nearby galaxies, as inferred by Peirani & Pacheco from recent observations of stellar velocities. We then consider the future effect on massive objects of an accelerating cosmological expansion driven by phantom energy, for which the universe is predicted to end in a `Big Rip' at a finite time in the future at which the scale factor becomes singular. In particular, we present a novel calculation of the time prior to the Big Rip that an object of a given mass and size will become gravitationally unbound.},

Several present-day distributions of the orbital elements are derived. For systems with M(2)/M(1) above 0.1 in the nearby G-dwarf sample, the following results are obtained: (1) The orbital period distribution is unimodal and can be approximated by a Gaussian-type relation with a median period of 180 yrs. (2) The short binaries are circularized up to orbital periods of about 11 d due to the tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the Galactic disk. (3) The tight binaries not affected by tidal effects (in the range between 11 and 1000 d) may reflect the initial binary formation process, and they have a mean eccentricity of 0.31 +/-0.04. For systems with M(2)/M(1) not greater than 0.1, the proportion of brown dwarf companions among the IAU velocity standards is estimated at 10 percent of the primaries, a value in good agreement with that found in the G-dwarf sample.},

These would bridge the gap between the approximately ten solar mass "stellar-mass" black holes that are the end-product of the life of a massive star, and the "supermassive" black holes with masses of millions to billions of solar masses found at the centers of massive galaxies. The discovery of black holes with intermediate mass is the key to understanding whether supermassive black holes can grow from stellar-mass black holes, or whether a more exotic process accelerated their growth only hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. Here we focus on searches for black holes with masses of 10^4-10^6 solar masses that are found at galaxy centers. We will refer to black holes in this mass range as "low-mass" black holes, since they are at the low-mass end of supermassive black holes. We review the searches for low-mass black holes to date and show tentative evidence, from the number of low-mass black holes that are discovered today in small galaxies, that the progenitors of supermassive black holes were formed as ten thousand to one-hundred thousand solar mass black holes via the direct collapse of gas.},

abstract = {We carry out two searches for periodic gravitational waves using the most sensitive few hours of data from the second LIGO science run. Both searches exploit fully coherent matched filtering and cover wide areas of parameter space, an innovation over previous analyses which requires considerable algorithm development and computational power. The first search is targeted at isolated, previously unknown neutron stars, covers the entire sky in the frequency band 160 728.8 Hz, and assumes a frequency derivative of less than 4×10-10Hz/s. The second search targets the accreting neutron star in the low-mass x-ray binary Scorpius X-1 and covers the frequency bands 464 484 Hz and 604 624 Hz as well as the two relevant binary orbit parameters. Because of the high computational cost of these searches we limit the analyses to the most sensitive 10 hours and 6 hours of data, respectively. Given the limited sensitivity and duration of the analyzed data set, we do not attempt deep follow-up studies. Rather we concentrate on demonstrating the data analysis method on a real data set and present our results as upper limits over large volumes of the parameter space. In order to achieve this, we look for coincidences in parameter space between the Livingston and Hanford 4-km interferometers. For isolated neutron stars our 95% confidence level upper limits on the gravitational wave strain amplitude range from 6.6×10-23 to 1×10-21 across the frequency band; for Scorpius X-1 they range from 1.7×10-22 to 1.3×10-21 across the two 20-Hz frequency bands. The upper limits presented in this paper are the first broadband wide parameter space upper limits on periodic gravitational waves from coherent search techniques. The methods developed here lay the foundations for upcoming hierarchical searches of more sensitive data which may detect astrophysical signals.},

@article{Riess1998,
abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda &gt; 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 &lt; 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M &gt;= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q_0 &lt; 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda &gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda &gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda &gt; 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 &gt;= 0.},

abstract = {Theoretically, bound binaries of massive black holes are expected as the natural outcome of mergers of massive galaxies. From the observational side, however, massive black hole binaries remain elusive. Velocity shifts between narrow and broad emission lines in quasar spectra are considered a promising observational tool to search for spatially unresolved, dynamically bound binaries. In this series of papers we investigate the nature of such candidates through analyses of their spectra, images and multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions. Here we investigate the properties of the optical spectra, including the evolution of the broad line profiles, of all the sources identified in our previous study. We find a diverse phenomenology of broad and narrow line luminosities, widths, shapes, ionization conditions and time variability, which we can broadly ascribe to 4 classes based on the shape of the broad line profiles: 1) Objects with bell-shaped broad lines with big velocity shifts (>1000 km/s) compared to their narrow lines show a variety of broad line widths and luminosities, modest flux variations over a few years, and no significant change in the broad line peak wavelength. 2) Objects with double-peaked broad emission lines tend to show very luminous and broadened lines, and little time variability. 3) Objects with asymmetric broad emission lines show a broad range of broad line luminosities and significant variability of the line profiles. 4) The remaining sources tend to show moderate to low broad line luminosities, and can be ascribed to diverse phenomena. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of massive black hole binary searches.},

abstract = {We use recent progress in simulating the production of magnetohydrodynamic jets around black holes to derive the cosmic spin history of the most massive black holes, with masses >$\sim$10^8 Msol. Assuming the jet efficiency depends on spin a, we can approximately reproduce the observed `radio loudness' of quasars and the local radio luminosity function. Using the X-ray luminosity function and the local mass function of supermassive black holes, SMBHs we can reproduce the individual radio luminosity functions of radio sources showing high- and low-excitation narrow emission lines. The data favour spin distributions that are bimodal, with one component around spin zero and the other close to maximal spin. In the low-excitation galaxies, the two components have similar amplitudes. For the high-excitation galaxies, the amplitude of the high-spin peak is typically much smaller than that of the low-spin peak. A bimodality should be seen in the radio loudness of quasars. We predict that the low-excitation galaxies are dominated by SMBHs with masses >$\sim$10^8 Msol, down to radio luminosity densities $\sim$10^21 W Hz-1 sr-1 at 1.4$\sim$GHz. Our model is also able to predict the radio luminosity function at z=1, and predicts it to be dominated by high-excitation galaxies above luminosity densities >$\sim$10^26 W Hz-1 sr-1, in full agreement with the observations. From our parametrisation and using the best fitting jet efficiencies there is marginal evidence for evolution in spin: the mean spin increases slightly from $\sim$0.25 at z=1 to $\sim$0.35 at z=0, and the fraction of SMBHs with a>=0.5 increases from 0.16+-0.03 at z=1 to 0.24+-0.09 at z=0. Our results are in excellent agreement with the mean radiative efficiency of quasars, as well as recent cosmological simulations. We discuss the implications in terms of accretion and SMBH mergers, and galactic black holes (Abridged).},

abstract = {We study the tidal disruption of binaries by a massive point mass (e.g. the black hole at the Galactic center), and we discuss how the ejection and capture preference between unequal-mass binary members depends on which orbit they approach the massive object. We show that the restricted three-body approximation provides a simple and clear description of the dynamics. The orbit of a binary with mass m around a massive object M should be almost parabolic with an eccentricity |1-e| < (m/M)^{1/3} << 1 for a member to be captured, while the other is ejected. Indeed, the energy change of the members obtained for a parabolic orbit can be used to describe non-parabolic cases. If a binary has an encounter velocity much larger than (M/m)^{1/3} times the binary rotation velocity, it would be abruptly disrupted, and the energy change at the encounter can be evaluated in a simple disruption model. We evaluate the probability distributions for the ejection and capture of circular binary members and for the final energies. In principle, for any hyperbolic (elliptic) orbit, the heavier member has more chance to be ejected (captured), because it carries a larger fraction of the orbital energy. However, if the orbital energy is close to zero, the difference between the two members becomes small, and there is practically no ejection and capture preference. The preference becomes significant when the orbital energy is comparable to the typical energy change at the encounter. We discuss its implications to hypervelocity stars and irregular satellites around giant planets.},

abstract = {A galaxy halo may contain a large number of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses in the range of 10^{2-6} solar mass. We propose to directly detect these IMBHs by observing multiply imaged QSO-galaxy or galaxy-galaxy strong lens systems in the submillimeter bands with high angular resolution. The silhouette of an IMBH in the lensing galaxy halo would appear as either a monopole-like or a dipole-like variation at the scale of the Einstein radius against the Einstein ring of the dust-emitting region surrounding the QSO. We use a particle tagging technique to dynamically populate a Milky Way-sized dark matter halo with black holes, and show that the surface mass density and number density of IMBHs have power-law dependences on the distance from the center of the host halo if smoothed on a scale of $\sim$ 1 kpc. Most of the black holes orbiting close to the center are freely roaming as they have lost their dark matter hosts during infall due to tidal stripping.

abstract = {The debate concerning the viability of f(R)-gravity as a natural extension of General Relativity could be realistically addressed by using results coming from binary pulsars like PSR 1913+16. To this end, we develop a quadrupolar approach to the gravitational radiation for a class of ana- lytic f(R)-models. We show that experimental results are compatible with a consistent range of f(R)-models. This means that f(R)-gravity is not ruled out by the observations and gravitational radiation (in strong field regime) could be a test-bed for such theories.},

The Killing spinor equations can be used to reduce the fourth-order differential equations of motion to the first order for both the domain wall and FLRW cosmological solutions. We obtain exact "BPS" domain walls that describe the smooth Randall-Sundrum II, AdS wormholes and the RG flow from IR to UV. We also obtain exact smooth cosmological solutions that describe the evolution from an inflationary starting point with a larger cosmological constant to an ever-expanding universe with a smaller cosmological constant. In addition, We find exact smooth solutions of pre-big bang models, bouncing or crunching universes. An important feature is that the scalar curvature R of all these metrics is varying rather than a constant. Another intriguing feature is that there are two different f(R) gravities that give rise to the same "BPS" solution. We also study linearized f(R) gravities in (A)dS vacua.},

abstract = {The cores of most galaxies are thought to harbour supermassive black holes, which power galactic nuclei by converting the gravitational energy of accreting matter into radiation. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the compact source of radio, infrared and X-ray emission at the centre of the Milky Way, is the closest example of this phenomenon, with an estimated black hole mass that is 4,000,000 times that of the Sun. A long-standing astronomical goal is to resolve structures in the innermost accretion flow surrounding Sgr A*, where strong gravitational fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted near the black hole. Radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5 mm and 7 mm have detected intrinsic structure in Sgr A*, but the spatial resolution of observations at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering. Here we report observations at a wavelength of 1.3 mm that set a size of 37(+16)(-10) microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of Sgr A*. This is less than the expected apparent size of the event horizon of the presumed black hole, suggesting that the bulk of Sgr A* emission may not be centred on the black hole, but arises in the surrounding accretion flow.},

abstract = {The spectral triple approach to noncommutative geometry allows one to develop the entire standard model (and supersymmetric extensions) of particle physics from a purely geometry stand point and thus treats both gravity and particle physics on the same footing. The bosonic sector of the theory contains a modification to Einstein-Hilbert gravity, involving a nonconformal coupling of curvature to the Higgs field and conformal Weyl term (in addition to a nondynamical topological term). In this paper we derive the weak field limit of this gravitational theory and show that the production and dynamics of gravitational waves are significantly altered. In particular, we show that the graviton contains a massive mode that alters the energy lost to gravitational radiation, in systems with evolving quadrupole moment. We explicitly calculate the general solution and apply it to systems with periodically varying quadrupole moments, focusing in particular on the the well know energy loss formula for circular binaries.},

In particular, gravitational wave detections in the 10^{-5}-10^{-1} Hz range will yield SMBH masses and spins to unprecedented precision and will provide clues to the properties of the otherwise undetectable stellar remnants expected to populate the centers of galaxies. Such observations are therefore keys to understanding the interplay between SMBHs and their environments.},

We consider an ensemble of systems near the peak of LISA's sensitivity band, with total rest mass of 2\times10^6 M\odot, a redshift of z = 1, and randomly chosen orientations and sky positions. We find median sky localization errors of approximately \sim3 arcminutes. This is comparable to the field of view of powerful electromagnetic telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, that could be used to search for electromagnetic signals associated with merging massive black holes. We investigate the way in which parameter errors decrease with measurement time, focusing specifically on the additional information provided during the merger-ringdown segment of the signal. We find that this information improves all parameter estimates directly, rather than through diminishing correlations with any subset of well- determined parameters. Although we have employed the baseline LISA design for this study, many of our conclusions regarding the information provided by mergers will be applicable to alternative mission designs as well.},

abstract = {The merger of close binary systems containing two neutron stars should produce a burst of gravitational waves, as predicted by the theory of general relativity. A reliable estimate of the double-neutron-star merger rate in the Galaxy is crucial in order to predict whether current gravity wave detectors will be successful in detecting such bursts. Present estimates of this rate are rather low, because we know of only a few double-neutron-star binaries with merger times less than the age of the Universe. Here we report the discovery of a 22-ms pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, which is a member of a highly relativistic double-neutron-star binary with an orbital period of 2.4 hours. This system will merge in about 85 Myr, a time much shorter than for any other known neutron-star binary. Together with the relatively low radio luminosity of PSR J0737-3039, this timescale implies an order-of-magnitude increase in the predicted merger rate for double-neutron-star systems in our Galaxy (and in the rest of the Universe).},

@article{Kocsis2014,
abstract = {Stars bound to a supermassive black hole interact gravitationally. Persistent torques acting between stellar orbits lead to the rapid resonant relaxation of the orbital orientation vectors ("vector" resonant relaxation) and slower relaxation of the eccentricities ("scalar" resonant relaxation), both at rates much faster than two-body or non-resonant relaxation. We describe a new parallel symplectic integrator, N-ring, which follows the dynamical evolution of a cluster of N stars through vector resonant relaxation, by averaging the pairwise interactions over the orbital period and periapsis-precession timescale. We use N-ring to follow the evolution of clusters containing over 10^4 stars for tens of relaxation times. Among other results, we find that the evolution is dominated by torques among stars with radially overlapping orbits, and that resonant relaxation can be modelled as a random walk of the orbit normals on the sphere, with angular step size ranging from 0.5-1 radian. The relaxation rate in a cluster with a fixed number of stars is proportional to the RMS mass of the stars. The RMS torque generated by the cluster stars is reduced below the torque between Kepler orbits due to apsidal precession and declines weakly with the eccentricity of the perturbed orbit. However since the angular momentum of an orbit also decreases with eccentricity, the relaxation rate is approximately eccentricity-independent for e<0.7 and grows rapidly with eccentricity for e>0.8. We quantify the relaxation using the autocorrelation function of the spherical multipole moments; this decays exponentially and the e-folding time may be identified with the vector resonant relaxation timescale tvrr. We provide estimates of tvrr as a function of the cluster parameters and determine the number of relaxation times required for the system to become completely mixed.},

abstract = {The Fisher-matrix formalism is used routinely in the literature on gravitational-wave detection to characterize the parameter-estimation performance of gravitational-wave measurements, given parametrized models of the waveforms, and assuming detector noise of known colored Gaussian distribution. Unfortunately, the Fisher matrix can be a poor predictor of the amount of information obtained from typical observations, especially for waveforms with several parameters and relatively low expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), or for waveforms depending weakly on one or more parameters, when their priors are not taken into proper consideration. In this paper I discuss these pitfalls; show how they occur, even for relatively strong signals, with a commonly used template family for binary-inspiral waveforms; and describe practical recipes to recognize them and cope with them.   Specifically, I answer the following questions: (i) What is the significance of (quasi-)singular Fisher matrices, and how must we deal with them? (ii) When is it necessary to take into account prior probability distributions for the source parameters? (iii) When is the signal-to-noise ratio high enough to believe the Fisher-matrix result? In addition, I provide general expressions for the higher-order, beyond--Fisher-matrix terms in the 1/SNR expansions for the expected parameter accuracies.},

@article{Sikora2007,
abstract = {We investigate how the total radio luminosity of AGN-powered radio sources depends on their accretion luminosity and the central black hole mass. Our studies cover about 7 orders of magnitude in accretion luminosity (expressed in Eddington units, i.e., as Eddington ratios) and the full range of AGN black hole masses. We find that AGNs form two distinct and well-separated sequences on the radio-loudness-Eddington-ratio plane. The ``upper'' sequence is formed by radio-selected AGNs, and the ``lower'' sequence contains mainly optically selected objects. Whereas an apparent ``gap'' between the two sequences may be an artifact of selection effects, the sequences themselves mark the real upper bounds of radio loudness of two distinct populations of AGNs: those hosted respectively by elliptical and disk galaxies. Both sequences show the same dependence of the radio loudness on the Eddington ratio (an increase with decreasing Eddington ratio), which suggests that the normalization of this dependence is determined by the black hole spin. This implies that central black holes in giant elliptical galaxies have (on average) much larger spins than black holes in spiral/disk galaxies. This galaxy-morphology-related radio dichotomy breaks down at high accretion rates where the dominant fraction of luminous quasars hosted by elliptical galaxies is radio quiet. This led to speculations in the literature that formation of powerful jets at high accretion rates is intermittent and related to switches between two disk accretion modes, as directly observed in some black hole X-ray binaries. We argue that such intermittency can be reconciled with the spin paradigm, provided that successful formation of relativistic jets by rotating black holes requires collimation by MHD outflows from accretion disks.},

abstract = {The observations of gravitational-wave signals from astrophysical sources such as binary inspirals will be used to test general relativity for self consistency and against alternative theories of gravity. I describe a simple formula that can be used to characterize the prospects of such tests, by estimating the matched-filtering signal-to-noise ratio required to detect non-general-relativistic corrections of a given magnitude. The formula is valid for sufficiently strong signals; it requires the computation of a single number (the fitting factor between the general-relativistic and corrected waveform families); and it can be applied to all tests that embed general-relativity in a larger theory, including tests of individual theories such as Brans--Dicke gravity, as well as the phenomenological schemes that introduce corrections and extra terms in the post-Newtonian phasing expressions of inspiral waveforms. Using the formula, I show on very general grounds that the volume-limited gravitational-wave searches performed with second-generation ground-based detectors would detect alternative-gravity corrections to general-relativistic waveforms as small as 1--10% (i.e., fitting factors of 0.9 to 0.99).},

abstract = {The density of stars in galactic bulges is often observed to be flat or slowly rising inside the influence radius of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Chandrasekhar's dynamical friction formula predicts little or no frictional force on a test body in such a core, regardless of its density, due to the absence of stars moving more slowly than the local circular velocity. We have tested this prediction using large-scale $N$-body experiments. The rate of orbital decay never drops precisely to zero, because stars moving faster than the test body also contribute to the frictional force. When the contribution from the fast-moving stars is included in the expression for the dynamical friction force, and the changes induced by the massive body on the stellar distribution are taken into account, Chandrasekhar's theory is found to reproduce the rate of orbital decay remarkably well. However, this rate is still substantially smaller than the rate predicted by Chandrasekhar's formula in its most widely-used forms, implying longer time scales for inspiral. Motivated by recent observations that suggest a parsec-scale core around the Galactic center SMBH, we investigate the evolution of a population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) as they spiral in to the center of the Galaxy. After $\sim 10$ Gyr, we find that the density of BHs can remain substantially less than the density in stars at all radii; we conclude that it would be unjustified to assume that the spatial distribution of BHs at the Galactic center is well described by steady-state models. One consequence is that rates of capture of BHs by the SMBH at the Galactic center (EMRIs) may be much lower than in standard models. When capture occurs, inspiraling BHs often reach the gravitational-radiation-dominated regime while on orbits that are still highly eccentric.},

abstract = {We study the effect of black hole spin on the accuracy of the post-Newtonian approximation. We focus on the gravitational energy flux for the quasicircular, equatorial, extreme mass-ratio inspiral of a compact object into a Kerr black hole of mass M and spin J. For a given dimensionless spin a=J/M^2 (in geometrical units), the energy flux depends only on the orbital velocity v or (equivalently) on the Boyer-Lindquist orbital radius r. We investigate the formal region of validity of the Taylor post-Newtonian expansion of the energy flux (which is known up to order v^8 beyond the quadrupole formula), generalizing previous work by two of us. The "error function" used to determine the region of validity of the post-Newtonian expansion can have two qualitatively different kinds of behavior, and we deal with these two cases separately. We find that, at any fixed post-Newtonian order, the edge of the region of validity (as measured by v/v_{ISCO}, where v_{ISCO} is the orbital velocity at the innermost stable circular orbit) is only weakly dependent on a. Unlike in the nonspinning case, the lack of sufficiently high order terms does not allow us to determine if there is a convergent to divergent transition at order v^6. Independently of a, the inclusion of angular multipoles up to and including l=5 in the numerical flux is necessary to achieve the level of accuracy of the best-known (N=8) PN expansion of the energy flux.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of a density gradient on Chandrasekhar's dynamical friction formula based on the method of 2-body encounters in the local approximation. We apply these generalizations to the orbit evolution of satellite galaxies in Dark Matter haloes. We find from the analysis that the main influence occurs through a position-dependent maximum impact parameter in the Coulomb logarithm, which is determined by the local scale-length of the density distribution. We also show that for eccentric orbits the explicit dependence of the Coulomb logarithm on position yields significant differences for the standard homogeneous force. Including the velocity dependence of the Coulomb logarithm yields ambigous results. The orbital fits in the first few periods are further improved, but the deviations at later times are much larger. The additional force induced by the density gradient, the inhomogeneous force, is not antiparallel to the satellite motion and can exceed 10% of the homogeneous friction force in magnitude. However, due to the symmetry properties of the inhomogeneous force, there is a deformation and no secular effect on the orbit at the first order. Therefore the inhomogeneous force can be safely neglected for the orbital evolution of satellite galaxies. For the homogeneous force we compare numerical N-body calculations with semi-analytical orbits to determine quantitatively the accuracy of the generalized formulae of the Coulomb logarithm in the Chandrasekhar approach. With the local scale-length as the maximum impact parameter we find a significant improvement of the orbital fits and a better interpretation of the quantitative value of the Coulomb logarithm.},

abstract = {Observations from optical to centimeter wavelengths have demonstrated that multiple systems of two or more bodies is the norm at all stellar evolutionary stages. Multiple systems are widely agreed to result from the collapse and fragmentation of cloud cores, despite the inhibiting influence of magnetic fields. Surveys of Class 0 protostars with mm interferometers have revealed a very high multiplicity frequency of about 2/3, even though there are observational difficulties in resolving close protobinaries, thus supporting the possibility that all stars could be born in multiple systems. Near-infrared adaptive optics observations of Class I protostars show a lower binary frequency relative to the Class 0 phase, a declining trend that continues through the Class II/III stages to the field population. This loss of companions is a natural consequence of dynamical interplay in small multiple systems, leading to ejection of members. We discuss observational consequences of this dynamical evolution, and its influence on circumstellar disks, and we review the evolution of circumbinary disks and their role in defining binary mass ratios. Special attention is paid to eclipsing PMS binaries, which allow for observational tests of evolutionary models of early stellar evolution. Many stars are born in clusters and small groups, and we discuss how interactions in dense stellar environments can significantly alter the distribution of binary separations through dissolution of wider binaries. The binaries and multiples we find in the field are the survivors of these internal and external destructive processes, and we provide a detailed overview of the multiplicity statistics of the field, which form a boundary condition for all models of binary evolution. Finally we discuss various formation mechanisms for massive binaries, and the properties of massive trapezia.},

abstract = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are expected to emit continuous gravitational waves in the pulsar timing array (PTA) frequency band ($10^{-9}$--$10^{-7}$ Hz). The development of data analysis techniques aimed at efficient detection and characterization of these signals is critical to the gravitational wave detection effort. In this paper we leverage methods developed for LIGO continuous wave gravitational searches, and explore the use of the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic for such searches in pulsar timing data. Babak & Sesana 2012 have already used this approach in the context of PTAs to show that one can resolve multiple SMBHB sources in the sky. Our work improves on several aspects of prior continuous wave search methods developed for PTA data analysis. The algorithm is implemented fully in the time domain, which naturally deals with the irregular sampling typical of PTA data and avoids spectral leakage problems associated with frequency domain methods. We take into account the fitting of the timing model, and have generalized our approach to deal with both correlated and uncorrelated colored noise sources. We also develop an incoherent detection statistic that maximizes over all pulsar dependent contributions to the likelihood. To test the effectiveness and sensitivity of our detection statistics, we perform a number of monte-carlo simulations. We produce sensitivity curves for PTAs of various configurations, and outline an implementation of a fully functional data analysis pipeline. Finally, we present a derivation of the likelihood maximized over the gravitational wave phases at the pulsar locations, which results in a vast reduction of the search parameter space.},

The observational and theoretical insights provided by this first double pulsar go far beyond applications in pulsar astrophysics alone. Timing observations of the two pulsars provide the best test of general relativity (GR) in strong gravitational fields. Studies of the system's evolution suggest the possibility of an unusual neutron star formation process. The discovery of this system has a significant impact on the expected coalescence rate of galactic double neutron stars and the detection of merging systems in Earth-bound gravitational-wave detectors. Moreover, observations and modeling of the eclipses provide evidence for relativistic spin precession and dipolar magnetic fields in pulsar magnetospheres.

abstract = {We present a new version of the fast star cluster evolution code Evolve Me A Cluster of StarS (EMACSS). While previous versions of EMACSS reproduced clusters of single-mass stars, this version models clusters with an evolving stellar content. Stellar evolution dominates early evolution, and leads to: (1) reduction of the mean mass of stars due to the mass loss of high-mass stars; (2) expansion of the half-mass radius; (3) for (nearly) Roche Volume filling clusters, the induced escape of stars. Once sufficient relaxation has occurred ($\sim$ 10 relaxation times-scales), clusters reach a second, 'balanced' state whereby the core releases energy as required by the cluster as a whole. In this state: (1) stars escape due to tidal effects faster than before balanced evolution; (2) the half-mass radius expands or contracts depending on the Roche volume filling factor; and (3) the mean mass of stars increases due to the preferential ejection of low-mass stars.   We compare the EMACSS results of several cluster properties against N-body simulations of clusters spanning a range of initial number of stars, mass, half-mass radius, and tidal environments, and show that our prescription accurately predicts cluster evolution for this database. Finally, we consider applications for EMACSS, such as studies of galactic globular cluster populations in cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {Proper motions and radial velocities of luminous infrared stars in the Galactic center have provided strong evidence for a dark mass of 2.5 × 10 6 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} in the central 0.05 pc of the Galaxy. The leading hypothesis for this mass is a black hole. High angular resolution measurements at radio wavelengths find a compact radio source, Sagittarius (Sgr) A*, that is either the faint glow from a small amount of material accreting onto the hole with low radiative efficiency or a miniature active galactic nucleus (AGN) core-jet system. This paper provides a full report on the first program that has measured the apparent proper motion of Sgr A* with respect to background extragalactic reference frame. Our current result is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/524/2/805/df1.gif] {df1.gif} The observations were obtained with the NRAO Very Large Array at 4.9 GHz over 16 yr. The proper motion of Sgr A* provides an estimate of its mass based on equipartition of kinetic energy between the hole and the surrounding stars. The measured motion is largest in galactic longitude. This component of the motion is consistent with the secular parallax that results from the rotation of the solar system about the center, which is a global measure of the difference between Oort's constants ( A - B ), with no additional peculiar motion of Sgr A*. The current uncertainty in Oort's galactic rotation constants limits the use of this component of the proper motion for a mass inference. In latitude, we find a small, and weakly significant, peculiar motion of Sgr A*, -19 ± 7 km s -1 after correction for the motion of the solar system with respect to the local standard of rest. We consider sources of peculiar motion of Sgr A* ranging from unstable radio wave propagation through intervening turbulent plasma to the effects of asymmetric masses in the center. These fail to account for a significant peculiar motion. One can appeal to an m = 1 dynamical instability that numerical simulations have revealed. However, the measurement of a latitude peculiar proper motion of comparable magnitude and error but with opposite sign in the companion paper by Reid leads us to conclude at the present time that our errors may be underestimated and that the actual peculiar motion might therefore be closer to zero. Improvement of these measurements with further observations and resolving the differences between independent experiments will provide the accuracies of a few km s -1 in both coordinates that will provide both a black hole mass estimate and a definitive determination of Oort's galactic rotation constants on a global Galactic scale.},

abstract = {When searching for gravitational waves in the data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors it is common to use a detection threshold to reduce the number of background events which are unlikely to be the signals of interest. However, imposing such a threshold will also discard some real signals with low amplitude, which can potentially bias any inferences drawn from the population of detected signals. We show how this selection bias is naturally avoided by using the full information from the search, considering both the selected data and our ignorance of the data that are thrown away, and considering all relevant signal and noise models. This approach produces unbiased estimates of parameters even in the presence of false alarms and incomplete data. This can be seen as an extension of previous methods into the high false rate regime where we are able to show that the quality of parameter inference can be optimised by lowering thresholds and increasing the false alarm rate.},

abstract = {This is a review of particle-theory models of inflation, and of their predictions for the primordial density perturbation that is thought to be the origin of structure in the Universe. It contains mini-reviews of the relevant observational cosmology, of elementary field theory and of supersymmetry, that may be of interest in their own right. The spectral index /n(k), specifying the scale dependence of the spectrum of the curvature perturbation, will be a powerful discriminator between models, when it is measured by Planck with accuracy /$\Delta$n$\sim$0.01. The usual formula for /n is derived, as well as its less familiar extension to the case of a multi-component inflaton; in both cases the key ingredient is the separate evolution of causally disconnected regions of the Universe. Primordial gravitational waves will be an even more powerful discriminator if they are observed, since most models of inflation predict that they are completely negligible. We treat in detail the new wave of models, which are firmly rooted in modern particle theory and have supersymmetry as a crucial ingredient. The review is addressed to both astrophysicists and particle physicists, and each section is fairly homogeneous regarding the assumed background knowledge.},

However, with the secular theory, the minimum value of the inner pericenter distance could be artificially blocked by the back-reaction of GW emission. Compared with traditional predictions, the actual evolution of an eccentric inner binary could be accompanied by (i) a higher characteristic frequency of the pulse-like GWs around its pericenter passages, and (ii) a larger residual eccentricity at its final inspiral phase. These findings would be important for GW astronomy with the forthcoming advanced detectors.},

abstract = {Recent studies of accretion onto supermassive black hole binaries suggest that much, perhaps most, of the matter eventually accretes onto one hole or the other. If so, then for binaries whose inspiral from $\sim$1 pc to 0.001 - 0.01 pc is driven by interaction with external gas, both the binary orbital axis and the individual black hole spins can be reoriented by angular momentum exchange with this gas. Here we show that, unless the binary mass ratio is far from unity, the spins of the individual holes align with the binary orbital axis in a time few-100 times shorter than the binary orbital axis aligns with the angular momentum direction of the incoming circumbinary gas; the spin of the secondary aligns more rapidly than that of the primary by a factor $\sim$(m_1/m_2)^{1/2}>1. Thus the binary acts as a stabilizing agent, so that for gas-driven systems, the black hole spins are highly likely to be aligned (or counteraligned if retrograde accretion is common) with each other and with the binary orbital axis. This alignment can significantly reduce the recoil speed resulting from subsequent black hole merger.},

abstract = {The cosmological consequences of the f(R) gravity are reviewed in the framework of recent data obtained by PAMELA (Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics) experiment. This collaboration has reported an excess of positron events that cannot be explained by conventional cosmology and particle physics, and are usually ascribed to the dark matter presence (in particular, weak interacting massive particles). The dark matter interpretation of PAMELA data has motivated the study of alternative cosmological models (with respect to the standard cosmology) owing to the fact that they predict an enhancement of the Hubble expansion rate, giving rise in such a way to thermal relics with a larger relic abundance. In this paper we face this problem for f(R) gravity models assuming a power law correction to the standard action of General Relativity, i.e. f(R) = R + \alpha R^n. In the regime in which the energy density induced by (higher order) curvature terms are greater than (or of the order of) the energy density of standard radiation, we find that the exponent n must assume values n > 1. In the opposite regime, taking into account the constraints provided by big bang nucleosynthesis, we get n < 1 + 2 \times 10^-3. The latter bound excludes the model f(R) = R + \alpha R^2. Our analysis shows that the considered model allows to explain the PAMELA puzzle for dark matter relic particles with masses greater or lesser than 10^2 GeV.},

abstract = {The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) project currently observes 43 pulsars using the Green Bank and Arecibo radio telescopes. In this work we use a subset of 17 pulsars timed for a span of roughly five years (2005--2010). We analyze these data using standard pulsar timing models, with the addition of time-variable dispersion measure and frequency-variable pulse shape terms. Within the timing data, we perform a search for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries in circular orbits using robust frequentist and Bayesian techniques. We find that there is no evidence for the presence of a detectable continuous gravitational wave; however, we can use these data to place the most constraining upper limits to date on the strength of such gravitational waves. Using the full 17 pulsar dataset we place a 95% upper limit on the sky-averaged strain amplitude of $h_0\lesssim 3.8\times 10^{-14}$ at a frequency of 10 nHz. Furthermore, we place 95% \emph{all sky} lower limits on the luminosity distance to such gravitational wave sources finding that the $d_L \gtrsim 425$ Mpc for sources at a frequency of 10 nHz and chirp mass $10^{10}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We find that for gravitational wave sources near our best timed pulsars in the sky, the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array is increased by a factor of $\sim$4 over the sky-averaged sensitivity. Finally we place limits on the coalescence rate of the most massive supermassive black hole binaries.},

For a total of 30 galaxies bulge masses were derived through Jeans equation modeling or adopted from dynamical models in the literature. In stellar mass-to-light ratios, the spheroids and bulges span a range of a factor of 8. The bulge masses were related to well-determined black hole masses taken from the literature. With these improved values for M bh , compared to Magorrian et al., and our redetermination of M bulge , we find that the M bh - M bulge relation becomes very tight.

abstract = {We report the discovery of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the nearby SAd galaxy NGC 3621 using Spitzer high spectral resolution observations. These observations reveal the presence of [Ne V] 14 and 24 $\mu$m emission that is centrally concentrated and peaks at the position of the near-infrared nucleus. Using the [Ne V] line luminosity, we estimate that the nuclear bolometric luminosity of the AGN is $\sim$5×1041 ergs s-1, which, based on the Eddington limit, corresponds to a lower mass limit of the black hole of $\sim$4×103 Msolar. Using an order-of-magnitude estimate for the bulge mass based on the Hubble type of the galaxy, we find that this lower mass limit does not put a strain on the well-known relationship between the black hole mass and the host galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion established in predominantly early-type galaxies. Multiwavelength follow-up observations of NGC 3621 are required to obtain more precise estimates of the bulge mass, black hole mass, accretion rate, and nuclear bolometric luminosity. The discovery reported here adds to the growing evidence that a black hole can form and grow in a galaxy with no or minimal bulge.},

Coalescing massive binary black holes are among the loudest sources of gravitational waves in the Universe, and the detection of these events is at the frontier of contemporary astrophysics. Understanding the black hole binary formation path and dynamics in galaxy mergers is therefore mandatory. A key question poses: during a merger, will the black holes descend over time on closer orbits, form a Keplerian binary and coalesce shortly after? Here we review progress on the fate of black holes in both major and minor mergers of galaxies, either gas-free or gas-rich, in smooth and clumpy circum-nuclear discs after a galactic merger, and in circum-binary discs present on the smallest scales inside the relic nucleus.},

abstract = {In general relativity, all black holes in vacuum are described by the Kerr metric, which has only two independent parameters: the mass and the spin. The unique dependence on these two parameters is known as the no-hair theorem. This theorem may be tested observationally by using electromagnetic or gravitational-wave observations to map the spacetime around a candidate black hole and measure potential deviations from the Kerr metric. Several parametric frameworks have been constructed for tests of the no-hair theorem. Due to the uniqueness of the Kerr metric, any such parametric framework must violate at least one of the assumptions of the no-hair theorem. This can lead to pathologies in the spacetime, such as closed timelike curves or singularities, which may hamper using the metric in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we analyze in detail several parametric frameworks and show explicitly the manner in which they differ from the Kerr metric. We calculate the coordinate locations of event horizons in these metrics, if any exist, using methods adapted from the numerical relativity literature. We identify the regions where each parametric deviation is unphysical as well as the range of coordinates and parameters for which each spacetime remains a regular extension of the Kerr metric and is, therefore, suitable for observational tests of the no-hair theorem.},

abstract = {One of the most interesting sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for LISA is the inspiral of compact objects on to a massive black hole (MBH), commonly referred to as an "extreme-mass ratio inspiral" (EMRI). The small object, typically a stellar black hole (bh), emits significant amounts of GW along each orbit in the detector bandwidth. The slowly, adiabatic inspiral of these sources will allow us to map space-time around MBHs in detail, as well as to test our current conception of gravitation in the strong regime. The event rate of this kind of source has been addressed many times in the literature and the numbers reported fluctuate by orders of magnitude. On the other hand, recent observations of the Galactic center revealed a dearth of giant stars inside the inner parsec relative to the numbers theoretically expected for a fully relaxed stellar cusp. The possibility of unrelaxed nuclei (or, equivalently, with no or only a very shallow cusp) adds substantial uncertainty to the estimates. Having this timely question in mind, we run a significant number of direct-summation $N-$body simulations with up to half a million particles to calibrate a much faster orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck code. We then investigate the regime of strong mass segregation (SMS) for models with two different stellar mass components. We show that, under quite generic initial conditions, the time required for the growth of a relaxed, mass segregated stellar cusp is shorter than a Hubble time for MBHs with $M_\bullet \lesssim 5 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ (i.e. nuclei in the range of LISA). SMS has a significant impact boosting the EMRI rates by a factor of $\sim 10$ for our fiducial models of Milky Way type galactic nuclei.},

abstract = {Within 5-10 years, very long baseline interferometry facilities will be able to observe the "shadow" of super-massive black hole candidates. This will allow, for the first time, to test gravity in the strong field regime. In this paper, we study numerically the photon orbits in the $\delta = 2$ Tomimatsu-Sato space-time. The $\delta = 2$ Tomimatsu-Sato space-time is a stationary, axisymmetric, and asymptotically flat exact solution of the vacuum Einstein equations. We compare the associated shadow with the one of Kerr black holes. The shape of the shadow in the $\delta = 2$ Tomimatsu-Sato space-time is oblate and the difference between the two axes can be as high as 6% when viewed on the equatorial plane. We argue that future space sub-mm interferometers (e.g. VSOP-3) may distinguish the two cases, and thus are able to test the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture.},

@article{Kochanek2014,
abstract = {We model the observed black hole mass function under the assumption that black hole formation is controlled by the compactness of the stellar core at the time of collapse. Low compactness stars are more likely to explode as supernovae and produce neutron stars, while high compactness stars are more likely to be failed supernovae that produce black holes with the mass of the helium core of the star. Using three sequences of stellar models and marginalizing over a model for the completeness of the black hole mass function, we find that the compactness xi(2.5) above which 50% of core collapses produce black holes is xi(2.5)=0.24 (0.15 < xi(2.5) < 0.37) at 90% confidence). While models with a sharp transition between successful and failed explosions are always the most likely, the width of the transition between the minimum compactness for black hole formation and the compactness above which all core collapses produce black holes is not well constrained. The models also predict that f=0.18 (0.09 < f < 0.39) of core collapses fail assuming a minimum mass for core collapse of 8Msun. We tested four other criteria for black hole formation based on xi(2.0) and xi(3.0), the compactnesses at enclosed masses of 2.0 or 3.0 rather than 2.5Msun, the mass of the iron core, and the mass inside the oxygen burning shell. We found that xi(2.0) works as well as xi(2.5), while the compactness xi(3.0) works significantly worse, as does using the iron core mass or the mass enclosed by the oxygen burning shell. As expected from the high compactness of 20-25Msun stars, black hole formation in this mass range provides a natural explanation of the red supergiant problem.},

abstract = {A general analytic procedure is developed to deal with the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity. A discussion comparing the Newtonian and the post-Newtonian limit of these models is proposed in order to point out the differences between the two approaches. We calculate the post-Newtonian parameters of such theories without any redefinition of the degrees of freedom, in particular, without adopting some scalar fields and without any change from Jordan to Einstein frame. Considering the Taylor expansion of a generic $f(R)$ theory, it is possible to obtain general solutions in term of the metric coefficients up to the third order of approximation. In particular, the solution relative to the $g_{tt}$ component gives a gravitational potential always corrected with respect to the Newtonian one of the linear theory $f(R)=R$. Furthermore, we show that the Birkhoff theorem is not a general result for $f(R)$-gravity since time-dependent evolution for spherically symmetric solutions can be achieved depending on the order of perturbations. Finally, we discuss the post-Minkowskian limit and the emergence of massive gravitational wave solutions.},

abstract = {When a compact object on a highly eccentric orbit about a much more massive body passes through periapsis it emits a short gravitational wave signal known as an extreme-mass-ratio burst (EMRB). We consider stellar mass objects orbiting the massive black hole (MBH) found in the Galactic Centre. EMRBs provide a novel means of extracting information about the MBH; an EMRB from the Galactic MBH could be highly informative regarding the MBH's mass and spin if the orbital periapsis is small enough. However, to be a useful astronomical tool EMRBs must be both informative and sufficiently common to be detectable with a space-based interferometer. We construct a simple model to predict the event rate for Galactic EMRBs. We estimate there could be on average $\sim$2 bursts in a two year mission lifetime for LISA. Stellar mass black holes dominate the event rate. Creating a sample of 100 mission realisations, we calculate what we could learn about the MBH. On average, we expect to be able to determine the MBH mass to $\sim$1% and the spin to $\sim$0.1 using EMRBs.},

abstract = {Mergers of neutron-star/neutron-star binaries are strong sources of gravitational waves. They can also launch subrelativistic and mildly relativistic outflows and are often assumed to be the sources of short $\gamma$-ray bursts. An electromagnetic signature that persisted for weeks to months after the event would strengthen any future claim of a detection of gravitational waves. Here we present results of calculations showing that the interaction of mildly relativistic outflows with the surrounding medium produces radio flares with peak emission at 1.4 gigahertz that persist at detectable (submillijansky) levels for weeks, out to a redshift of 0.1. Slower subrelativistic outflows produce flares detectable for years at 150 megahertz, as well as at 1.4 gigahertz, from slightly shorter distances. The radio transient RT 19870422 (ref. 11) has the properties predicted by our model, and its most probable origin is the merger of a compact neutron-star/neutron-star binary. The lack of radio detections usually associated with short $\gamma$-ray bursts does not constrain the radio transients that we discuss here (from mildly relativistic and subrelativistic outflows) because short $\gamma$-ray burst redshifts are typically >0.1 and the appropriate timescales (longer than weeks) have not been sampled.},

abstract = {We examine the possibility that the observed relation between black-hole mass and host-galaxy stellar velocity dispersion (the M-sigma relation) is biased by an observational selection effect, the difficulty of detecting a black hole whose sphere of influence is smaller than the telescope resolution. In particular, we critically investigate recent claims that the M-sigma relation only represents the upper limit to a broad distribution of black-hole masses in galaxies of a given velocity dispersion. We find that this hypothesis can be rejected at a high confidence level, at least for the early-type galaxies with relatively high velocity dispersions (median 268 km/s) that comprise most of our sample. We also describe a general procedure for incorporating observational selection effects in estimates of the properties of the M-sigma relation. Applying this procedure we find results that are consistent with earlier estimates that did not account for selection effects, although with larger error bars. In particular, (i) the width of the M-sigma relation is not significantly increased; (ii) the slope and normalization of the M-sigma relation are not significantly changed; (iii) most or all luminous early-type galaxies contain central black holes at zero redshift. Our results may not apply to late-type or small galaxies, which are not well-represented in our sample.},

abstract = {The orbits of stars close to a massive black hole (MBH) are nearly Keplerian ellipses. Such orbits exert long-term torques on each other, which lead to an enhanced angular momentum relaxation known as resonant relaxation. Under certain conditions, this process can modify the angular momentum distribution and affect the interaction rates of the stars with the MBH more efficiently than non-resonant relaxation. The torque on an orbit exerted by the cluster depends on the eccentricity of the orbit. In this paper, we calculate this dependence and determine the resonant relaxation time-scale as a function of eccentricity. In particular, we show that the component of the torque that changes the magnitude of the angular momentum is linearly proportional to eccentricity, so resonant relaxation is much more efficient on eccentric orbits than on circular orbits.},

Equations governing stationary force-free electromagnetic fields in Kerr spacetime are derived, and it is found that energy and angular momentum can be extracted from a rotating black hole by a purely electromagnetic mechanism. A perturbation technique is outlined for calculating approximate solutions under certain circumstances, and solutions are obtained for a split monopole magnetic field as well as for a paraboloidal magnetic field.

We highlight areas of consensus and disagreement, and stress ideas which should point the way forward for progress in this important but long-standing and largely unconquered problem. Unusually for CEE-related work, we mostly try to avoid relying on results from population synthesis or observations, in order to avoid potentially being misled by previous misunderstandings. As far as possible we debate all the relevant issues starting from physics alone, all the way from the evolution of the binary system immediately before CEE begins to the processes which might occur just after the ejection of the envelope. In particular, we include extensive discussion about the energy sources and sinks operating in CEE, and hence examine the foundations of the standard energy formalism. Special attention is also given to comparing the results of hydrodynamic simulations from different groups and to discussing the potential effect of initial conditions on the differences in the outcomes. We compare current numerical techniques for the problem of CEE and also whether more appropriate tools could and should be produced (including new formulations of computational hydrodynamics, and attempts to include 3D processes within 1D codes). Finally we explore new ways to link CEE with observations. We compare previous simulations of CEE to the recent outburst from V1309 Sco, and discuss to what extent post-common-envelope binaries and nebulae can provide information, e.g. from binary eccentricities, which is not currently being fully exploited.},

abstract = {We discuss the inspiral of a small body around a Kerr black hole. When the time scale of the radiation reaction is sufficiently longer than its orbital period, the leading order orbital evolution is described only by the knowledge of the averaged evolution of the constants of motion, i.e., the energy, azimuthal angular momentum and the Carter constant. Although there is no conserved current composed of the perturbation field corresponding to the Carter constant, it has been shown that the averaged rate of change of the Carter constant can be given by a simple formula, when there exists a simultaneous turning point of the radial and polar oscillations. However, an inspiralling orbit may cross a "resonance" point, where the frequencies of the radial and polar orbital oscillations are in a rational ratio. At the resonance point, one cannot find a simultaneous turning point in general. Hence, even for the averaged rate of change of the Carter constant, a direct computation of the 'self-force", which is still challenging especially in the case of the Kerr background, seems to be necessary. In this paper, we present a method of computing the averaged rate of change of the Carter constant in a relatively simple manner at the "resonance" point.},

We find that the spin parameters of black holes in Sgr A* and in Galactic X-ray sources have a unique value of $\approx 0.44$ which is smaller than the generally accepted value for supermassive black holes, suggesting evidence for the angular momentum extraction of black holes during the growth of supermassive black holes. Our results demonstrate that the spin parameter approaches the equilibrium value where spin-up via accretion is balanced by spin-down via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism regardless of its initial spin.

abstract = {A stellar-mass compact object spiraling into a supermassive black hole, an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI), is one of the targets of future gravitational-wave detectors and it offers a unique opportunity to test General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field. We study whether generic scalar-tensor (ST) theories can be further constrained with EMRIs. We show that in the EMRI limit, all such theories universally reduce to massive or massless Brans-Dicke theory and that black holes do not emit dipolar radiation to all orders in post-Newtonian (PN) theory. For massless theories, we calculate the scalar energy flux in the Teukolsky formalism to all orders in PN theory and fit it to a high-order PN expansion. We derive the PN ST corrections to the Fourier transform of the gravitational wave response and map it to the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework. We use the effective-one-body framework adapted to EMRIs to calculate the ST modifications to the gravitational waveform. We find that such corrections are smaller than those induced in the early inspiral of comparable-mass binaries, leading to projected bounds on the coupling that are worse than current Solar System ones. Brans-Dicke theory modifies the weak-field, with deviations in the energy flux that are largest at small velocities. For massive theories, superradiance can lead to resonances in the scalar energy flux that can lead to floating orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit and that last until the supermassive black hole loses enough mass and spin-angular momentum. If such floating orbits occur in the frequency band of LISA, they would lead to a large dephasing ($\sim$1e6 rads), preventing detection with GR templates. A detection that is consistent with GR would then rule out floating resonances at frequencies lower than the lowest observed frequency, allowing for the strongest constraints yet on massive ST theories.},

abstract = {In many theoretical scenarios it is expected that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, with masses -->M $\sim$ 102–104 M☉) reside at the centers of some globular clusters. However, observational evidence for their existence is limited. Several previous numerical investigations have focused on the impact of an IMBH on the cluster dynamics or brightness profile. Here we instead present results from a large set of direct N-body simulations including single and binary stars. These show that there is a potentially more detectable IMBH signature, namely on the variation of the average stellar mass between the center and the half-light radius. We find that the existence of an IMBH quenches mass segregation and causes the average mass to exhibit only modest radial variation in collisionally relaxed star clusters. This differs from when there is no IMBH. To measure this observationally requires high-resolution imaging at the level of that already available from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for the cores of a large sample of Galactic globular clusters. With a modest additional investment of HST time to acquire fields around the half-light radius, it will be possible to identify the best candidate clusters to harbor an IMBH. This test can be applied only to globulars with a half-light relaxation time 1 Gyr, which is required to guarantee efficient energy equipartition due to two-body relaxation.},

abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;The production of a stochastic background of relic gravitational waves is well known in various works in the literature, where, by using the so called adiabatically-amplified zero-point fluctuations process, it has been shown how the standard inflationary scenario for the early universe can in principle provide a distinctive spectrum of relic gravitational waves. In this paper, it is shown that, in general, f(R) theories of gravity produce a third massive polarization of gravitational waves and the primordial production of this polarization is analyzed adapting the adiabatically-amplified zero-point fluctuations process at this case. In this way, previous results, where only particular cases of f(R) theories have been analyzed, will be generalized. The presence of the mass could also have important applications in cosmology, because the fact that gravitational waves can have mass could give a contribution to the dark matter of the Universe. An upper bound for these relic gravitational waves, which arises from the WMAP constrains, is also mentioned. At the end of the paper, the potential detection of such massive gravitational waves using interferometers like Virgo and LIGO is discussed.},

abstract = {We present a model for merger-driven evolution of the mass function for massive galaxies and their central supermassive black holes at late times. We discuss the current observational evidence in favor of merger-driven massive galaxy evolution during this epoch, and demonstrate that the observed evolution of the mass function can be reproduced by evolving an initial mass function under the assumption of negligible star formation. We calculate the stochastic gravitational wave signal from the resulting black-hole binary mergers in the low redshift universe (z < 1) implied by this model, and find that this population has a signal-to-noise ratio as much as $\sim$5x larger than previous estimates for pulsar timing arrays, with an expectation value for the characteristic strain h_c(f =1 yr^{-1})=5.8 x 10^{-15} that is already in tension with observational constraints, and a 2-sigma lower limit within this model of h_c(f =1 yr^{-1})=2.0 x 10^{-15}. The strength of this signal may therefore be detectable with the data already collected using the current generation of pulsar timing arrays, and could be detected with high statistical significance under conservative assumptions within the next few years, if the principle assumption of merger-driven galaxy evolution since z=1 holds true. For cases where a galaxy merger fails to lead to a black hole merger, we estimate the probability for a given number of satellite unmerged black holes to remain within a massive host galaxy, and interpret the result in light of ULX observations. In particular, we find that the brightest cluster galaxies should have 1-2 such sources with luminosities above 10^{39} erg/s, which is consistent with the statistics of observed ULXs.},

We study non-zero constant scalar curvature solutions and discuss the metric tensor that satisfies the modified field equations. We determine that, in absence of a cosmological constant, the black holes existence is determined by the sign of a parameter dependent of the mass, the charge, the spin and the scalar curvature. We obtain that for negative values of the curvature, the extremal black hole is no longer given by a spin parameter a_max = M (as is the case in General Relativity), but by a_max < M, and that for positive values of the curvature there are two kinds of extremal black holes: the usual one, that occurs for a_max > M, and the extreme marginal one, where the exterior (but not interior) black hole's horizon vanishes provided that a < a_min. Thermodynamics for this kind of black holes is then studied, as well as their local and global stability. Finally we study different f(R) models and see how these properties manifest for their parameters phase space.},

@article{Ivanov2007,
abstract = {(abbreviated) We consider how tight binaries consisting of a super-massive black hole of mass $M=10^{3}-10^{4}M_{\odot}$ and a white dwarf can be formed in a globular cluster. We point out that a major fraction of white dwarfs tidally captured by the black hole may be destroyed by tidal inflation during ongoing circularisation, and the formation of tight binaries is inhibited. However, some stars may survive being spun up to high rotation rates. Then the energy loss through gravitational wave emission induced by tidally excited pulsation modes and dissipation through non linear effects may compete with the increase of pulsation energy due to dynamic tides. The semi-major axes of these stars can be decreased below a 'critical' value where dynamic tides are not effective because pulsation modes retain phase coherence between successive pericentre passages. The rate of formation of such circularising stars is estimated assuming that they can be modelled as $n=1.5$ polytropes and that results of the tidal theory for slow rotators can be extrapolated to fast rotators. We estimate the total capture rate as $\sim \dot N\sim 2.5\cdot 10^{-8}M_{4}^{1.3}r_{0.1}^{-2.1}yr^{-1}$, where $M_{4}=M/10^4M_{\odot}$ and $r_{0.1}$ is the radius of influence of the black hole in units $0.1pc$. We find that the formation rate of tight pairs is approximately 10 times smaller than the total capture rate. It is used to estimate the probability of detection of gravitational waves coming from such tight binaries by LISA. We conclude that LISA may detect such binaries provided that the fraction of globular clusters with black holes in the mass range of interest is substantial and that the dispersion velocity of the cluster stars near the radius of influence of the black hole exceeds $\sim 20km/s$.},

We expand the first-order post-Newtonian Hamiltonian to leading-order in the ratio of the semi-major axis of the two orbits. In addition to the well-known terms that correspond to the GR precession of the inner and outer orbits, we find a new secular post-Newtonian interaction term that can affect the long-term evolution of the triple. We explore the parameter space for highly inclined and eccentric systems, where the Kozai-Lidov mechanism can produce large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricities. The standard lore, i.e., that General Relativity effects suppress eccentricity, is only consistent with the parts of phase space where the General Relativity timescales are several orders of magnitude shorter than the secular Newtonian one. In other parts of phase space, however, post-Newtonian corrections combined with the three body ones, can excite eccentricities. In particular, for systems where the General Relativity timescale is comparable to the secular Newtonian timescales, the three-body interactions give rise to a resonant-like eccentricity excitation. Furthermore, for triples with a comparable-mass inner binary, where the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism is suppressed, post-Newtonian corrections can further increase the eccentricity and lead to orbital flips even when the timescale of the former is much longer than the timescale of the secular Kozai-Lidov quadrupole perturbations.},

abstract = {Results are presented from high-precision computations of the orbital evolution and emitted gravitational waves for a stellar-mass object spiraling into a massive black hole in a slowly shrinking, circular, equatorial orbit. The focus of these computations is inspiral near the innermost stable circular orbit (isco)---more particularly, on orbits for which the angular velocity Omega is 0.03 < Omega/Omega_{isco} < 1. The computations are based on the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura formalism, and the results are tabulated in a set of functions that are of order unity and represent relativistic corrections to low-orbital-velocity formulas. These tables can form a foundation for future design studies for the LISA space-based gravitational-wave mission. A first survey of applications to LISA is presented: Signal to noise ratios S/N are computed and graphed as functions of the time-evolving gravitational-wave frequency for representative values of the hole's mass M and spin a and the inspiraling object's mass \mu, with the distance to Earth chosen to be r_o = 1 Gpc. These S/N's show a very strong dependence on the black-hole spin, as well as on M and \mu. A comparison with predicted event rates shows strong promise for detecting these waves, but not beyond about 1Gpc if the inspiraling object is a white dwarf or neutron star. This argues for a modest lowering of LISA's noise floor. A brief discussion is given of the prospects for extracting information from the observed waves},

In the non-relativistic limit, we get an additional Yukawa correction with coupling strength $G/3$ and Compton wave length $\sqrt{6a}$ to the Newtonian potential, which is a known result in the literature. As an application, we derive to the same order the correction to the geodetic precession of a gyroscope in a gravitational field and the precession of binary pulsars. The result of the Gravity Probe B experiment yields the limit $a \lesssim 5 \times 10^{11} \, \mathrm{m}^2$, whereas for the pulsar B in the PSR J0737-3039 system we get a bound which is about $10^4$ times larger. On the other hand the E\"ot-Wash experiment provides the best laboratory bound $a \lesssim 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}^2$. Although the former bounds from geodesic precession are much larger than the laboratory ones, they are still meaningful in the case some type of chameleon effect is present and thus the effective values could be different at different length scales.},

However, the extremely weak coupling between GWs and ordinary matter makes these waves very difficult to detect directly. Fortunately, the inspiraling BH system will interact strongly--on a purely Newtonian level--with any surrounding material in the host galaxy, and this matter can in turn produce unique electromagnetic (EM) signals detectable at Earth. By identifying EM counterparts to GW sources, we will be able to study the host environments of the merging BHs, in turn greatly expanding the scientific yield of a mission like LISA.},

Advanced ground based interferometers covering the kHz frequency range will be online by 2016, and it is foreseeable the announcement of a first detection within five years. At the same time, a worldwide effort of detecting low frequency waves (in the nHz regime) by timing ultra-precise millisecond pulsars is rapidly growing, possibly leading to a positive detection within this decade. The mHz regime, bridging these two windows, is the realm of space based interferometers, which might be launched in the late 20s. I provide here a short overview of the scientific payouts of gravitational wave astronomy, focusing the discussion on the low frequency regime (pulsar timing and space based interferometry).

abstract = {The recent discovery of a 2 M⊙ binary millisecond pulsar not only has important consequences for the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities but also raises the interesting question of whether the neutron star PSR J1614-2230 was born massive. The answer is vital for understanding neutron star formation in core collapse supernovae. Furthermore, this system raises interesting issues about the nature of the progenitor binary and how it evolved during its mass-exchanging X-ray phase. In this paper we discuss the progenitor evolution of PSR J1614-2230. We have performed detailed stellar evolution modelling of intermediate-mass X-ray binaries undergoing Case A Roche lobe overflow (RLO) and applied an analytic parametrization for calculating the outcome of either a common envelope evolution or the highly super-Eddington isotropic re-emission mode. We find two viable possibilities for the formation of the PSR J1614-2230 system: either it contained a 2.2-2.6 M⊙ giant donor star and evolved through a common envelope and spiral-in phase or, more likely, it descended from a close binary system with a 4.0-5.0 M⊙ main-sequence donor star via Case A RLO. We conclude that the neutron star must have been born with a mass of either ˜1.95 M⊙ or 1.7 ± 0.15 M⊙, which significantly exceeds neutron star birth masses in previously discovered radio pulsar systems. Based on the expected neutron star birth masses from considerations of stellar evolution and explosion models, we find it likely that the progenitor star of PSR J1614-2230 was more massive than 20 M⊙.},

We strongly constrain non-dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity with a timelike Chern-Simons scalar through observations of the double binary pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B. We first calculate Chern-Simons corrections to the orbital evolution of binary systems. We find that the ratio of the correction to periastron precession to the general relativistic prediction scales quadratically with the semi-major axis and inversely with the square of the object's radius. Binary pulsar systems are thus ideal to test this theory, since periastron precession can be measured with sub-degree accuracies and the semi-major axis is millions of times larger than the stellar radius. Using data from PSR J0737-3039A/B we dramatically constrain the non-dynamical Chern-Simons coupling to $M_{\CS} := 1/|\dot{\vartheta}| > 33 {\textrm{meV}}$, approximately a hundred billion times better than current Solar System tests.},

The motivation for considering such theories, stemming from Cosmology, High Energy Physics and Astrophysics is thoroughly discussed (cosmological problems, dark energy and dark matter problems, the lack of success so far in obtaining a successful formulation for Quantum Gravity). The basic principles which a gravitational theory should follow, and their geometrical interpretation, are analysed in a broad perspective which highlights the basic assumptions of General Relativity and suggests possible modifications which might be made. A number of such possible modifications are presented, focusing on certain specific classes of theories: scalar-tensor theories, metric f(R) theories, Palatini f(R) theories, metric-affine f(R) theories and Gauss--Bonnet theories. The characteristics of these theories are fully explored and attention is payed to issues of dynamical equivalence between them. Also, cosmological phenomenology within the realm of each of the theories is discussed and it is shown that they can potentially address the well-known cosmological problems. A number of viability criteria are presented: cosmological observations, Solar System tests, stability criteria, existence of exact solutions for common vacuum or matter configurations etc. Finally, future perspectives in the field of modified gravity are discussed and the possibility for going beyond a trial-and-error approach to modified gravity is explored.},

abstract = {Mass and spin are often referred to as the two `hairs' of astrophysical black holes, as they are the only two parameters needed to completely characterize them in General Relativity. The interaction between black holes and their environment is where complexity lies, as the relevant physical processes occur over a large range of scales. This is particularly relevant in the case of super-massive black holes (SMBHs), hosted in galaxy centers and surrounded by swirling gas and various generations of stars, that compete with the SMBH for gas consumption, and affect the thermodynamics of the gas itself. How dynamics and thermodynamics in such fiery environment affect the angular momentum of the gas accreted onto SMBHs, and hence black hole spins is uncertain. We explore the interaction between SMBHs and their environment during active phases through simulations of circum-nuclear discs (CND) around black holes in quasars hosted in the remnants of galaxy mergers. These are the first 3D (sub-)parsec resolution simulations that study the evolution of the SMBH spin explicitly including the effects of star formation, stellar winds, supernova feedback, and radiative transfer. This approach is crucial to investigate the angular momentum of the material that is accreted by the hole. We find that maximally rotating black holes are slightly spun down, and slow-rotating holes are spun up, leading to upper-intermediate equilibrium values of the spin parameter ($\sim$0.7-0.9). Our results suggest that, when quasar activity is driven by mergers of galaxies of similar sizes, stellar feedback does not induce strong chaos in the gas inflow, and that most SMBHs at the end of the quasar epoch have substantial spins.},

abstract = {The angular momentum evolution of stars close to massive black holes (MBHs) is driven by secular torques. In contrast to two-body relaxation, where interactions between stars are incoherent, the resulting resonant relaxation (RR) process is characterized by coherence times of hundreds of orbital periods. In this paper, we show that all the statistical properties of RR can be reproduced in an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. We use the ARMA model, calibrated with extensive N-body simulations, to analyze the long-term evolution of stellar systems around MBHs with Monte Carlo simulations. We show that for a single mass system in steady state, a depression is carved out near a MBH as a result of tidal disruptions. In our Galactic center, the size of the depression is about 0.2 pc, consistent with the size of the observed "hole" in the distribution of bright late-type stars. We also find that the velocity vectors of stars around a MBH are locally not isotropic. In a second application, we evolve the highly eccentric orbits that result from the tidal disruption of binary stars, which are considered to be plausible precursors of the "S-stars" in the Galactic center. We find that in this scenario more highly eccentric (e > 0.9) S-star orbits are produced than have been observed to date.},

The future space based gravitational wave observatory Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect up to a hundred of those events, providing very accurate measurements of their luminosity distances. To constrain the cosmological parameters we also need to measure the redshift of the galaxy (or cluster of galaxies) hosting the merger. This requires the identification of a distinctive electromagnetic event associated to the binary coalescence. However, putative electromagnetic signatures may be too weak to be observed. Instead, we study here the possibility of constraining the cosmological parameters by enforcing statistical consistency between all the possible hosts detected within the measurement error box of a few dozen of low redshift (z<3) events. We construct MBH populations using merger tree realizations of the dark matter hierarchy in a LambdaCDM Universe, and we use data from the Millennium simulation to model the galaxy distribution in the LISA error box. We show that, assuming that all the other cosmological parameters are known, the parameter w describing the dark energy equation of state can be constrained to a 4-8% level (2sigma error), competitive with current uncertainties obtained by type Ia supernovae measurements, providing an independent test of our cosmological model.},

We focus on simple models of modified gravity mediated by a massive scalar field coupled to both baryons and cold dark matter. This captures the features of chameleon, symmetron, dilaton and $f(R)$ models. We find that the CMB peaks can be affected in three independent ways provided the Compton radius of the massive scalar is not far-off the sound horizon at last scattering. When the coupling of the massive scalar to Cold Dark Matter (CDM) is large, the anomalous growth of the CDM perturbation inside the Compton radius induces a change in the peak amplitudes. When the coupling to baryons is moderately large, the speed of sound is modified and the peaks shifted to higher momenta. Finally when both couplings are non-vanishing, a new contribution proportional to the Newton potential appears in the Sachs-Wolfe temperature and increases the peak amplitudes. We also show how, given any temporal evolution of the scalar field mass, one can engineer a corresponding modified gravity model of the chameleon type. This opens up the possibility of having independent constraints on modified gravity from the CMB peaks and large scale structures at low redshifts.},

abstract = {Classical generalization of general relativity is considered as gravitational alternative for unified description of the early-time inflation with late-time cosmic acceleration. The structure and cosmological properties of number of modified theories, including traditional $F(R)$ and Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz $F(R)$ gravity, scalar-tensor theory, string-inspired and Gauss-Bonnet theory, non-local gravity, non-minimally coupled models, and power-counting renormalizable covariant gravity are discussed. Different representations and relations between such theories are investigated. It is shown that some versions of above theories may be consistent with local tests and may provide qualitatively reasonable unified description of inflation with dark energy epoch. The cosmological reconstruction of different modified gravities is made in great detail. It is demonstrated that eventually any given universe evolution may be reconstructed for the theories under consideration: the explicit reconstruction is applied to accelerating spatially-flat FRW universe. Special attention is paid to Lagrange multiplier constrained and conventional $F(R)$ gravities, for last theory the effective $\Lambda$CDM era and phantom-divide crossing acceleration are obtained. The occurrence of Big Rip and other finite-time future singularities in modified gravity is reviewed as well as its curing via the addition of higher-derivative gravitational invariants.},

abstract = {Our understanding of massive star evolution is in flux, due to recent upheavals in our view of mass loss, and observations of a high binary fraction among O-type stars. Mass-loss rates for standard metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are now thought to be lower by a factor of 2-3 compared to rates adopted in modern stellar evolution models, due to the influence of clumping. Weaker line-driven winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal elsewhere, so that the dominant modes of mass loss are the winds, pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just a few years before core collapse. The shifting emphasis from steady winds to episodic mass loss is a major change for low-metallicity regions, since eruptions and binary mass transfer are less sensitive to metallicity. We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of single-star evolution models beyond core H burning. Moreover, the influence of winds and rotation in models has been evaluated by testing single-star models against observed statistics that, as it turns out, are heavily influenced by binary evolution. This alters our view about the most basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss --- are WR stars and SNe Ibc the products of single-star winds, or are they mostly the result of binary evolution and eruptive mass loss? This paradigm shift has far-reaching impact on a number of other areas of astronomy. (abridged)},

abstract = {We present an updated and improved Mbh-$\sigma$ diagram containing 64 galaxies for which Mbh measurements (not just upper limits) are available. Because of new and increased black hole masses at the high-mass end, and a better representation of barred galaxies at the low-mass end, the 'classical' (all morphological type) Mbh-$\sigma$ relation for predicting black hole masses is log (Mbh/Mȯ) = (8.13 ± 0.05) + (5.13 ± 0.34)log [$\sigma$/200 km s-1], with an rms scatter of 0.43 dex. Modifying the regression analysis to correct for a hitherto overlooked sample bias in which black holes with masses &lt;106 Mȯ are not (yet) detectable, the relation steepens further to give log (Mbh/Mȯ) = (8.15 ± 0.06) + (5.95 ± 0.44)log [$\sigma$/200 km s-1]. We have also updated the 'barless' and 'elliptical-only'Mbh-$\sigma$ relations introduced by Graham and Hu in 2008 due to the offset nature of barred galaxies. These relations have a total scatter as low as 0.34 dex and currently define the upper envelope of points in the Mbh-$\sigma$ diagram. They also have a slope consistent with a value 5, in agreement with the prediction by Silk &amp; Rees based on feedback from massive black holes in bulges built by monolithic collapse.  Using updated virial products and velocity dispersions from 28 active galactic nuclei, we determine that the optimal scaling factor f- which brings their virial products in line with the 64 directly measured black hole masses - is 2.8+0.7-0.5. This is roughly half the value reported by Onken et al. and Woo et al., and consequently halves the mass estimates of most high-redshift quasars. Given that barred galaxies are, on average, located ˜0.5 dex below the 'barless' and 'elliptical-only'Mbh-$\sigma$ relations, we have explored the results after separating the samples into barred and non-barred galaxies, and we have also developed a preliminary corrective term to the velocity dispersion based on bar dynamics. In addition, given the recently recognized coexistence of massive black holes and nuclear star clusters, we present the first ever (Mbh+Mnc)-$\sigma$ diagram and begin to explore how galaxies shift from their former location in the Mbh-$\sigma$ diagram.},

Sources such as coalescing compact binary systems, neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, stellar collapses and pulsars are all possible candidates for detection. The most promising design of gravitational wave detector uses test masses a long distance apart and freely suspended as pendulums on Earth or in drag-free craft in space. The main theme of this review is a discussion of the mechanical and optical principles used in the various long baseline systems in operation around the world - LIGO (USA), Virgo (Italy/France), TAMA300 and LCGT (Japan), and GEO600 (Germany/U.K.) - and in LISA, a proposed space-borne interferometer. A review of recent science runs from the current generation of ground-based detectors will be discussed, in addition to highlighting the astrophysical results gained thus far. Looking to the future, the major upgrades to LIGO (Advanced LIGO), Virgo (Advanced Virgo), LCGT and GEO600 (GEO-HF) will be completed over the coming years, which will create a network of detectors with significantly improved sensitivity required to detect gravitational waves. Beyond this, the concept and design of possible future "third generation" gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), will be discussed.},

abstract = {X-ray irradiation of the accretion disc leads to strong reflection features, which are then broadened and distorted by relativistic effects. We present a detailed, general relativistic approach to model this irradiation for different geometries of the primary X-ray source. These geometries include the standard point source on the rotational axis as well as more jet-like sources, which are radially elongated and accelerating. Incorporating this code in the relline model for relativistic line emission, the line shape for any configuration can be predicted. We study how different irradiation geometries affect the determination of the spin of the black hole. Broad emission lines are produced only for compact irradiating sources situated close to the black hole. This is the only case where the black hole spin can be unambiguously determined. In all other cases the line shape is narrower, which could either be explained by a low spin or an elongated source. We conclude that for all those cases and independent of the quality of the data, no unique solution for the spin value exists.},

We demonstrate that by adopting analysis parameters that naturally characterize this 'picture', the physical parameters of the system can be extracted more efficiently from the gravitational wave data, and interpreted more easily. We assess the performance of MCMC parameter estimation in this physically intuitive coordinate system, defined by (a) a frame anchored on the binary's spins and orbital angular momentum and (b) a time at which the detectors are most sensitive to the binary's gravitational wave emission. Using anticipated noise curves for the advanced-generation LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors, we find that this careful choice of reference frame and reference time significantly improves parameter estimation efficiency for BNS, NS-BH, and BBH signals.},

Illustris is a large scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulation which resolves a (106.5 Mpc)^3 volume with more than 12 billion resolution elements and includes state-of-the-art physical models relevant for galaxy formation. We find that the black hole mass density for redshifts z = 0 - 5 and the black hole mass function at z = 0 predicted by Illustris are in excellent agreement with the most recent observational constraints. We show that the bolometric and hard X-ray luminosity functions of AGN at z = 0 reproduce observational data very well over the full dynamic range probed. This requires radiative efficiencies to be on average low, epsilon_r <= 0.1, unless the bolometric corrections are largely underestimated. Cosmic downsizing of the AGN population is in broad agreement with the findings from X-ray surveys, but we caution that obscuration effects may introduce systematic biases in the flux-limited samples at the faint end. We also study black hole - host galaxy scaling relations as a function of galaxy morphology, colour and specific star formation rate. We find that black holes and galaxies co-evolve at the massive end, but for low mass, blue and star-forming galaxies there is no tight relation with either their central black hole masses or the nuclear AGN activity.},

abstract = {We develop a Bayesian linear regression method which rigorously treats measurement uncertainties, and accounts for hierarchical data structure for investigating the relationship between the star formation rate and gas surface density. The method simultaneously estimates the intercept, slope, and scatter about the regression line of each individual subject (e.g. a galaxy) and the population (e.g. an ensemble of galaxies). Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that the Bayesian method accurately recovers the parameters of both the individuals and the population, especially when compared to commonly employed least squares methods, such as the bisector. We apply the Bayesian method to estimate the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) parameters of a sample of spiral galaxies compiled by Bigiel et al. (2008). We find significant variation in the KS parameters, indicating that no single KS relationship holds for all galaxies. This suggests that the relationship between molecular gas and star formation differs between galaxies, possibly due to the influence of other physical properties within a given galaxy, such as metallicity, molecular gas fraction, and/or stellar mass. In four of the seven galaxies the slope estimates are well below unity, especially for M51, within the $2\sigma$ level. We estimate the mean index of the KS relationship for the population to be 0.84, with 95% range [0.63, 1.0]. The sub-linear KS relationship estimated from the ensemble and for individual galaxies suggests that CO emission is tracing some molecular gas which is not directly associated with star formation. The hierarchical Bayesian method can account for all sources of uncertainties, including variations in the conversion of observed luminosities to star formation rates and gas surface densities (e.g. the X_CO factor), and is therefore well suited for a thorough statistical analysis of the KS relationship.},

abstract = {Cosmological gravitational waves (GWs) are usually associated with the transverse traceless part of the metric perturbations in the context of the theory of cosmological perturbations. These modes are just the usual polarizations '+' and '×' which appear in the general relativity theory. However, in the majority of the alternative theories of gravity, GWs can present more than these two polarization states. In this context, the Newman–Penrose formalism is particularly suitable for evaluating the number of non-null GW modes. In the present work we intend to take into account these extra polarization states for cosmological GWs in alternative theories of gravity. As an application, we derive the dynamical equations for cosmological GWs for two specific theories, namely a general scalar–tensor theory which presents four polarization states and a massive bimetric theory which is in the most general case with six polarization states for GWs. However, the mathematical tool presented here is quite general, so it can be used to study cosmological perturbations in all metric theories of gravity.},

abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices $\alpha$ are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by $\Delta$$\alpha$$\sim$0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto &amp; Zoccali; Paresce &amp; De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M\'{e}ndez &amp; Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

abstract = {Millisecond pulsars are neutron stars that are thought to have been spun-up by mass accretion from a stellar companion. It is not known whether there is a natural brake for this process, or if it continues until the centrifugal breakup limit is reached at submillisecond periods. Many neutron stars that are accreting mass from a companion star exhibit thermonuclear X-ray bursts that last tens of seconds, caused by unstable nuclear burning on their surfaces. Millisecond-period brightness oscillations during bursts from ten neutron stars (as distinct from other rapid X-ray variability that is also observed) are thought to measure the stellar spin, but direct proof of a rotational origin has been lacking. Here we report the detection of burst oscillations at the known spin frequency of an accreting millisecond pulsar, and we show that these oscillations always have the same rotational phase. This firmly establishes burst oscillations as nuclear-powered pulsations tracing the spin of accreting neutron stars, corroborating earlier evidence. The distribution of spin frequencies of the 11 nuclear-powered pulsars cuts off well below the breakup frequency for most neutron-star models, supporting theoretical predictions that gravitational radiation losses can limit accretion torques in spinning up millisecond pulsars.},

abstract = {We present observations with XMM-Newton of M33 X-8, the ultraluminous X-ray source (L_{0.5-10 keV} $\sim$ 2x10^39 erg/s) closest to the centre of the galaxy. The best-fit model is similar to the typical model of Galactic black holes in very high state. Comparison with previous observations indicates that the source is still in a very high state after about 20 years of observations. No state transition has been observed even during the present set of XMM-Newton observations. We estimate the lower limit of the mass of the black hole >6 M_sun, but with proper parameters taking into account different effects, the best estimate becomes 12 M_sun. Our analysis favours the hypothesis that M33 X-8 is a stellar mass black hole candidate, in agreement with the findings of other authors. In addition, we propose a different model where the high luminosity of the source is likely to be due to orientation effects of the accretion disc and anisotropies in the Comptonized emission.},

abstract = {We have further followed the evolution of the orbital and physical properties of G2, the object currently falling toward the massive black hole in the Galactic Center on a near-radial orbit. New, very sensitive data were taken in April 2013 with NACO and SINFONI at the ESO VLT . The 'head' of G2 continues to be stretched ever further along the orbit in position-velocity space. A fraction of its emission appears to be already emerging on the blue-shifted side of the orbit, past pericenter approach. Ionized gas in the head is now stretched over more than 15,000 Schwarzschild radii RS around the pericenter of the orbit, at $\sim$ 2000 RS $\sim$ 20 light hours from the black hole. The pericenter passage of G2 will be a process stretching over a period of at least one year. The Brackett-{\gamma} luminosity of the head has been constant over the past 9 years, to within +- 25%, as have the line ratios Brackett-{\gamma} / Paschen-{\alpha} and Brackett-{\gamma} / Helium-I. We do not see any significant evidence for deviations of G2's dynamical evolution, due to hydrodynamical interactions with the hot gas around the black hole, from a ballistic orbit of an initially compact cloud with moderate velocity dispersion. The constant luminosity and the increasingly stretched appearance of the head of G2 in the position-velocity plane, without a central peak, is not consistent with several proposed models with continuous gas release from an initially bound zone around a faint star on the same orbit as G2.},

abstract = {Massive black holes in galactic nuclei vary their mass M and spin vector J due to accretion. In this study we relax, for the first time, the assumption that accretion can be either chaotic, i.e. when the accretion episodes are randomly and isotropically oriented, or coherent, i.e. when they occur all in a preferred plane. Instead, we consider different degrees of anisotropy in the fueling, never confining to accretion events on a fixed direction. We follow the black hole growth evolving contemporarily mass, spin modulus a and spin direction. We discover the occurrence of two regimes. An early phase (M <$\sim$ 10 million solar masses) in which rapid alignment of the black hole spin direction to the disk angular momentum in each single episode leads to erratic changes in the black hole spin orientation and at the same time to large spins (a $\sim$ 0.8). A second phase starts when the black hole mass increases above >$\sim$ 10 million solar masses and the accretion disks carry less mass and angular momentum relatively to the hole. In the absence of a preferential direction the black holes tend to spin-down in this phase. However, when a modest degree of anisotropy in the fueling process (still far from being coherent) is present, the black hole spin can increase up to a $\sim$ 1 for very massive black holes (M >$\sim$ 100 million solar masses), and its direction is stable over the many accretion cycles. We discuss the implications that our results have in the realm of the observations of black hole spin and jet orientations.},

abstract = {Dynamical mass measurements to date have allowed determinations of the mass M and the distance D of a number of nearby supermassive black holes. In the case of Sgr A*, these measurements are limited by a strong correlation between the mass and distance scaling roughly as M $\sim$ D 2. Future very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations will image a bright and narrow ring surrounding the shadow of a supermassive black hole, if its accretion flow is optically thin. In this paper, we explore the prospects of reducing the correlation between mass and distance with the combination of dynamical measurements and VLBI imaging of the ring of Sgr A*. We estimate the signal-to-noise ratio of near-future VLBI arrays that consist of five to six stations, and we simulate measurements of the mass and distance of Sgr A* using the expected size of the ring image and existing stellar ephemerides. We demonstrate that, in this best-case scenario, VLBI observations at 1 mm can improve the error on the mass by a factor of about two compared to the results from the monitoring of stellar orbits alone. We identify the additional sources of uncertainty that such imaging observations have to take into account. In addition, we calculate the angular diameters of the bright rings of other nearby supermassive black holes and identify the optimal targets besides Sgr A* that could be imaged by a ground-based VLBI array or future space-VLBI missions allowing for refined mass measurements.},

Variation leads to a new integral constraint equation which determines the classical value of the effective CC that dominates the wave function of the universe. In a realistic cosmological model, the expected value of the effective CC, is calculated from measurable quantities to be 1/t_U^2, as observed, where t_U is the present age of the universe. Any application of our model produces a falsifiable prediction for Lambda in terms of other measurable quantities. This leads to a specific and falsifiable prediction for the observed spatial curvature parameter of Omega_k0=-0.0055. Our explanation of the CC requires no fine tunings or extra dark-energy fields and is testable.},

The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Cal\'{a}n/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8Omega_M-0.6Omega_Lambda$\sim$-0.2+/-0.1 in the region of interest (Omega_M<$\sim$1.5). For a flat (Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1) cosmology we find Omega^flat_M=0.28^+0.09_-0.08 (1 sigma statistical) ^+0.05_-0.04 (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda>0)=99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t^flat_0=14.9^+1.4_-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Cal\'{a}n/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

abstract = {A typical galaxy is thought to contain tens of millions of stellar-mass black holes, the collapsed remnants of once massive stars, and a single nuclear supermassive black hole. Both classes of black holes accrete gas from their environments. The accreting gas forms a flattened orbiting structure known as an accretion disk. During the past several years, it has become possible to obtain measurements of the spins of the two classes of black holes by modeling the x-ray emission from their accretion disks. Two methods are employed, both of which depend upon identifying the inner radius of the accretion disk with the innermost stable circular orbit, whose radius depends only on the mass and spin of the black hole. In the Fe K$\alpha$ method, which applies to both classes of black holes, one models the profile of the relativistically broadened iron line with a special focus on the gravitationally redshifted red wing of the line. In the continuum-fitting (CF) method, which has so far only been applied to stellar-mass black holes, one models the thermal x-ray continuum spectrum of the accretion disk. We discuss both methods, with a strong emphasis on the CF method and its application to stellar-mass black holes. Spin results for eight stellar-mass black holes are summarized. These data are used to argue that the high spins of at least some of these black holes are natal, and that the presence or absence of relativistic jets in accreting black holes is not entirely determined by the spin of the black hole.},

@article{Satyapal2009,
abstract = {Using the Spitzer telescope, we have conducted a high-resolution spectroscopic study of 18 bulgeless (Hubble type of Sd or Sdm) galaxies that show no definitive signatures of nuclear activity in their optical spectra. This is the first systematic mid-infrared (MIR) search for weak or hidden active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in a statistically significant sample of bulgeless (Sd/Sdm) disk galaxies. Based on the detection of the high-ionization [Ne V] 14.3 $\mu$m line, we report the discovery of an AGN in 1 out of the 18 galaxies in the sample. This galaxy, NGC 4178, is a nearby edge-on Sd galaxy, which likely hosts a prominent nuclear star cluster (NSC). The bolometric luminosity of the AGN inferred from the [Ne V] line luminosity is $\sim$8 × 1041 ergs s-1. This is almost 2 orders of magnitude greater than the luminosity of the AGN in NGC 4395, the best studied AGN in a bulgeless disk galaxy. Assuming that the AGN in NGC 4178 is radiating below the Eddington limit, the lower mass limit for the black hole is $\sim$6 × 103 M sun. The fact that none of the other galaxies in the sample shows any evidence for an AGN demonstrates that while the AGN detection rate based on MIR diagnostics is high (30%-40%) in optically quiescent galaxies with pseudobulges or weak classical bulges (Hubble type Sbc and Sc), it drops drastically in Sd/Sdm galaxies. Our observations, therefore, confirm that AGNs in completely bulgeless disk galaxies are not hidden in the optical but truly are rare. Of the three Sd galaxies with AGNs known so far, all have prominent NSCs, suggesting that in the absence of a well-defined bulge, the galaxy must possess an NSC in order to host an AGN. On the other hand, while the presence of an NSC appears to be a requirement for hosting an AGN in bulgeless galaxies, neither the properties of the NSC nor those of the host galaxy appear exceptional in late-type AGN host galaxies. The recipe for forming and growing a central black hole in a bulgeless galaxy therefore remains unknown.},

We measure the full orbital parameters of the system using its light curve, which shows ellipsoidal variations, Doppler boosting, and primary and secondary eclipses. The primary is a 0.25 Msun tidally distorted helium WD, only the second tidally distorted WD known. The unseen secondary is a 0.55 Msun carbon-oxygen WD. The two WDs will come into contact in 0.9 Myr due to loss of energy and angular momentum via gravitational wave radiation. Upon contact the systems may merge yielding a rapidly spinning massive WD, form a stable interacting binary, or possibly explode as an underluminous supernova type Ia. The system currently has a gravitational wave strain of 10^-22, about 10,000 times larger than the Hulse-Taylor pulsar; this system would be detected by the proposed LISA gravitational wave mission in the first week of operation. This system's rapid change in orbital period will provide a fundamental test of general relativity.},

The large inspiral parameter space and low amplitude of the signal make detection of these sources computationally challenging. We outline here a first-cut data analysis scheme that assumes realistic computational resources. In the context of this scheme, we estimate the signal-to-noise ratio that a source requires to pass our thresholds and be detected. Combining this with an estimate of the population of sources in the universe, we estimate the number of inspiral events that LISA could detect. The preliminary results are very encouraging—with the baseline design, LISA can see inspirals out to a redshift z = 1 and should detect over a thousand events during the mission lifetime.},

We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced.

@article{Darwin1961,
abstract = {This is a sequel to a paper of 3 years ago, which studied the orbits of `comets' near a `sun' regarded as a point source of gravitation according to general relativity. That paper expressed the forms of the orbits in terms of elliptic functions, but its method was not so well adapted to a study of the time in those orbits. In the first half of the present work these orbits and their associated times are described in a simple form, the results being expressed in terms of integrals of elementary functions, which can be easily worked out either by quadratures or by approximation. One result of the earlier paper was the proof that no orbit can have perihelion inside r = 3m, and in the later part of the present work a method is proposed in order to study this region, since no comet can return from it. It is supposed that flashes are emitted both from a distant observatory and from a comet, each signalling the ticks of his clock according to the time it is keeping. These are observed by the other and compared with the time on its own clock. The method serves to describe occurrences between r = 3m and the `barrier' at r = 2m, and it points to some unexpected results in the matter of the comet passing the barrier, which call for explanation.},

@article{Glampedakis2002a,
abstract = {We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a test-body around a Kerr black hole under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. We have adopted a well established two-step approach: assuming that the particle is moving along a geodesic (justifiable as long as the orbital evolution is adiabatic) we calculate numerically the fluxes of energy and angular momentum radiated to infinity and to the black hole horizon, via the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. We can then infer the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum and thus the evolution of the orbit. The orbits are fully described by a semilatus rectum p and an eccentricity e. We find that while, during the inspiral, e decreases until shortly before the orbit reaches the separatrix of stable bound orbits [which is defined by ps(e)], in many astrophysically relevant cases the eccentricity will still be significant in the last stages of the inspiral. In addition, when a critical value pcrit(e) is reached, the eccentricity begins to increase as a result of continued radiation induced inspiral. The two values ps, pcrit (for given e) move closer to each other, in coordinate terms, as the black hole spin is increased, as they do also for fixed spin and increasing eccentricity. Of particular interest are moderate and high eccentricity orbits around rapidly spinning black holes, with p(e)≈ps(e). We call these “zoom-whirl” orbits, because of their characteristic behavior involving several revolutions around the central body near periastron. Gravitational waveforms produced by such orbits are calculated and shown to have a very particular signature. Such signals may well prove of considerable astrophysical importance for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna detector.},

abstract = {We examine the electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signatures of stellar-mass compact objects (COs) spiraling into a supermassive black hole (extreme mass-ratio inspirals or EMRIs), embedded in a thin, radiation-pressure dominated, accretion disk. At large separations, the tidal effect of the secondary CO clears a gap. We show that the gap refills during the late GW-driven phase of the inspiral, leading to a sudden EM brightening of the source. The accretion disk leaves an imprint on the GW through its angular momentum exchange with the binary, the mass increase of the binary members due to accretion, and its gravity. We compute the disk-modified GWs both in an analytical Newtonian approximation and in a numerical effective-one-body approach. We find that disk-induced migration provides the dominant perturbation to the inspiral, with weaker effects from the mass accretion onto the CO and hydrodynamic drag. Depending on whether a gap is present, the perturbation of the GW phase is between 10 and 1000 radians per year, detectable with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) at high significance. The Fourier transform of the disk-modified GW in the stationary phase approximation is sensitive to disk parameters with a frequency trend different from post-Newtonian vacuum corrections. Our results suggest that observations of EMRIs may place new sensitive constraints on the physics of accretion disks.},

@article{Rauch1998,
abstract = {It has recently been shown by Rauch 38 Tremaine that the rate of angular momentum relaxation in nearly Keplerian star clusters is greatly increased by a process termed `resonant relaxation' it was also argued, via a series of scaling arguments, that tidal disruption of stars in galactic nuclei containing massive black holes could be noticeably enhanced by this process. We describe here the results of numerical simulations of resonant tidal disruption which quantitatively test the predictions made by Rauch 38 Tremaine. The simulation method is based on an N-body routine incorporating cloning of stars near the loss cone and a semirelativistic symplectic integration scheme. Normalized disruption rates for resonant and non-resonant nuclei are derived at orbital energies both above and below the critical energy, and the corresponding angular momentum distribution functions are found. The black hole mass above which resonant tidal disruption is quenched by relativistic precession is determined. We also briefly describe the discovery of chaos in the Wisdom-Holman symplectic integrator applied to highly eccentric orbits and propose a modified integration scheme that remains robust under these conditions. We find that resonant disruption rates exceed their non-resonant counterparts by an amount consistent with the predictions; in particular, we estimate the net tidal disruption rate for a fully resonant cluster to be about twice that of its non-resonant counterpart. No significant enhancement in rates is observed outside the critical radius. Relativistic quenching of the effect is found to occur for hole masses M&gt;M_Q=(8+/-3)x10^7M. The numerical results combined with the observed properties of galactic nuclei indicate that for most galaxies the resonant enhancement to tidal disruption rates will be very small.},

During the next months, we expect that in addition to the tidal effects, hydrodynamics get important, when G2 collides with the hot ambient gas around Sgr A*. Simulations show that ultimately, the cloud's material might fall into the massive black hole.

In the last few years of such inspirals, the total phase is in the millions of radians and details of the waveforms are sensitive to small perturbations. We show that one potentially detectable perturbation is the presence of a second supermassive black hole within a few tenths of a parsec. The acceleration produced by the perturber on the extreme mass-ratio system produces a steady drift that causes the waveform to deviate systematically from that of an isolated system. If the perturber is a few tenths of a parsec from the extreme-mass ratio system (plausible in as many as a few percent of cases) higher derivatives of motion might also be detectable. In that case, the mass and distance of the perturber can be derived independently, which would allow a new probe of merger dynamics.},

Following the observation that stars on counter-rotating (with respect to the MBHB) orbits extract angular momentum from the binary more efficiently then their co-rotating counterparts, the eccentricity evolution of the MBHB must depend on the degree of co-rotation (counter-rotation) of the surrounding stellar distribution. Using an hybrid scheme that couples numerical three-body scatterings to an analytical formalism for the cusp-binary interaction, we verify this hypothesis by evolving the MBHB in spherically symmetric cusps with different fractions F of co-rotating stars. Consistently with previous works, binaries in isotropic cusps (F=0.5) tend to increase their eccentricity, and when F approaches zero (counter-rotating cusps) the eccentricity rapidly increases to almost unity. Conversely, binaries in cusps with a significant degree of co-rotation (F>0.7) tend to become less and less eccentric, circularising quite quickly for F approaching unity. Direct N-body integrations performed to test the theory, corroborate the results of the hybrid scheme, at least at a qualitative level. We discuss quantitative differences, ascribing their origin to the oversimplified nature of the hybrid approach.},

abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first of five connected papers detailing progress on the Gravity Probe B (GP-B) Relativity Mission. GP-B, launched 20 April 2004, is a landmark physics experiment in space to test two fundamental predictions of Einstein’s general relativity theory, the geodetic and frame-dragging effects, by means of cryogenic gyroscopes in Earth orbit. Data collection began 28 August 2004 and science operations were completed 29 September 2005. The data analysis has proven deeper than expected as a result of two mutually reinforcing complications in gyroscope performance: (1)&nbsp;a changing polhode path affecting the calibration of the gyroscope scale factor C g against the aberration of starlight and (2)&nbsp;two larger than expected manifestations of a Newtonian gyro torque due to patch potentials on the rotor and housing. In earlier papers, we reported two methods, ‘geometric’ and ‘algebraic’, for identifying and removing the first Newtonian effect (‘misalignment torque’), and also a preliminary method of treating the second (‘roll-polhode resonance torque’). Central to the progress in both torque modeling and C g determination has been an extended effort on “Trapped Flux Mapping” commenced in November 2006. A turning point came in August 2008 when it became possible to include a detailed history of the resonance torques into the computation. The East-West (frame-dragging) effect is now plainly visible in the processed data. The current statistical uncertainty from an analysis of 155&nbsp;days of data is 5.4 marc-s/yr (∼14% of the predicted effect), though it must be emphasized that this is a preliminary result requiring rigorous investigation of systematics by methods discussed in the accompanying paper by Muhlfelder et al. A&nbsp;covariance analysis incorporating models of the patch effect torques indicates that a 3–5% determination of frame-dragging is possible with more complete, computationally intensive data analysis.},

abstract = {The observation of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is one of the goals of gravitational wave astronomy in the coming years. Massive (>10^8 solar masses) and low-redshift (< 1.5) sources are expected to be individually resolved by up-coming PTAs, and our ability to use them as astrophysical probes will depend on the accuracy with which their parameters can be measured. In this paper we estimate the precision of such measurements using the Fisher-information-matrix formalism. We restrict to "monochromatic" sources. In this approximation, the system is described by seven parameters and we determine their expected statistical errors as a function of the number of pulsars in the array, the array sky coverage, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal. At fixed SNR, the gravitational wave astronomy capability of a PTA is achieved with $\sim$20 pulsars; adding more pulsars (up to 1000) to the array reduces the source error-box in the sky \Delta\Omega by a factor $\sim$5 and has negligible consequences on the statistical errors on the other parameters. \Delta\Omega improves as 1/SNR^2 and the other parameters as 1/SNR. For a fiducial PTA of 100 pulsars uniformly distributed in the sky and a coherent SNR = 10, we find \Delta\Omega$\sim$40 deg^2, a fractional error on the signal amplitude of $\sim$30% (which constraints only very poorly the chirp mass - luminosity distance combination M_c^{5/3}/D_L), and the source inclination and polarization angles are recovered at the $\sim$0.3 rad level. The ongoing Parkes PTA is particularly sensitive to systems located in the southern hemisphere, where at SNR = 10 the source position can be determined with \Delta\Omega $\sim$10 deg^2, but has poorer performance for sources in the northern hemisphere.

abstract = {AbstractRelativistic X-ray emission lines from the inner accretion disks around black holes are reviewed. Recent observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission-Newton, and Suzaku are revealing these lines to be good probes of strong gravitational effects. A number of important observational and theoretical developments are highlighted, including evidence of black hole spin and effects such as gravitational light bending, the detection of relativistic lines in stellar-mass black holes, and evidence of orbital-timescale line flux variability. In addition, the robustness of the relativistic disk lines against absorption, scattering, and continuum effects is discussed. Finally, prospects for improved measures of black hole spin and understanding the spin history of supermassive black holes in the context of black hole–galaxy coevolution are presented. The best data and most rigorous results strongly suggest that relativistic X-ray disk lines can drive new explorations of General R...},

abstract = {In 4-dimensional General Relativity, black holes are described by the Kerr solution and are subject to the bound $|a_*| \le 1$, where $a_*$ is the black hole spin parameter. If current black hole candidates are not the black holes predicted in General Relativity, this bound does not hold and $a_*$ might exceed 1. In this letter, I relax the Kerr black hole hypothesis and I find that the value of the spin parameter of the super-massive black hole candidates in galactic nuclei cannot be higher than about 1.2. A higher spin parameter would not be consistent with a radiative efficiency $\eta > 0.15$, as observed at least for the most luminous AGN. While a rigorous proof is lacking, I conjecture that the bound $|a_*| \lesssim 1.2$ is independent of the exact nature of these objects.},

@article{Ade2013b,
abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data. [Abridged]},

abstract = {We investigate the linearized form of metric f(R)-gravity, assuming that f(R) is analytic about R = 0 so it may be expanded as f(R) = R + a_2 R^2/2 + ... . Gravitational radiation is modified, admitting an extra mode of oscillation, that of the Ricci scalar. We derive an effective energy-momentum tensor for the radiation. We also present weak-field metrics for simple sources. These are distinct from the equivalent Kerr (or Schwarzschild) forms. We apply the metrics to tests that could constrain f(R). We show that light deflection experiments cannot distinguish f(R)-gravity from general relativity as both have an effective post-Newtonian parameter \gamma = 1. We find that planetary precession rates are enhanced relative to general relativity; from the orbit of Mercury we derive the bound |a_2| < 1.2 \times 10^18 m^2. Gravitational wave astronomy may be more useful: considering the phase of a gravitational waveform we estimate deviations from general relativity could be measurable for an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral about a 10^6 M_sol black hole if |a_2| > 10^17 m^2, assuming that the weak-field metric of the black hole coincides with that of a point mass. However Eot-Wash experiments provide the strictest bound |a_2| < 2 \times 10^-9 m^2. Although the astronomical bounds are weaker, they are still of interest in the case that the effective form of f(R) is modified in different regions, perhaps through the chameleon mechanism. Assuming the laboratory bound is universal, we conclude that the propagating Ricci scalar mode cannot be excited by astrophysical sources.},

abstract = {There is a distinct possibility that current and future cosmological data can be used to constrain Einstein's theory of gravity on the very largest scales. To be able to do this in a model-independent way, it makes sense to work with a general parameterization of modified gravity. Such an approach would be analogous to the Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) approach which is used on the scale of the Solar System. A few such parameterizations have been proposed and preliminary constraints have been obtained. We show that the majority of such parameterizations are only exactly applicable in the quasistatic regime. On larger scales they fail to encapsulate the full behaviour of typical models currently under consideration. We suggest that it may be possible to capture the additions to the `Parameterized Post-Friedmann' (PPF) formalism by treating them akin to fluid perturbations.},

abstract = {The centers of stellar spheroids are often marked by the presence of nucleated central regions, called nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The origin of NSCs is still unclear. Here we investigate the possibility that NSCs originate from the migration and merger of stellar clusters at the center of galaxies where a massive black hole (MBH) may sit. We show that the observed relation between NSC masses and the velocity dispersion of their host spheroids cannot be reconciled with a purely in-situ formation scenario. On the other hand, the observed relation appears to be in agreement with the predictions of the cluster merger model which also reproduces the observed relation between the size of NSCs and their total luminosity. We evolve through dynamical friction a population of stellar clusters in a model of a galactic bulge taking into account dynamical dissolution, starting from a power-law cluster initial mass function and a total mass in stellar clusters consistent with the cluster formation efficiency of the Milky Way (MW). The most massive clusters reach the center of the galaxy and merge to form a compact nucleus; after 10 Gyr, the resulting NSC has properties that are consistent with the observed distribution of stars in the MW NSC. When a MBH is included at the center of a galaxy, globular clusters are tidally disrupted during inspiral, resulting in NSCs with lower densities than those of NSCs forming in galaxies with no MBHs. We suggest this as a possible explanation for the lack of NSCs in galaxies containing MBHs more massive than $\sim$10^8M_Sun. Finally, we investigate the orbital evolution of globular clusters in giant elliptical galaxies which are believed to always host a MBH at their center rather than a NSC. In these systems an additional mechanism can prevent a NSC from forming: the time for globular clusters to reach the center of the galaxy is much longer than the Hubble time.},

The approach is largely from first principles, the main aim being to impart a basic understanding of the relevant theory with an eye to the likely intense activity of the next few years, but the current observational status of the model is also critically assessed. The evolution of adiabatic and isocurvature density perturbations is described, and their effect on the large scale cmb anisotropy calculated as well as that of any gravitational waves. The generation of all three types of perturbation during inflation is described, and the normalisation and spectral indices are calculated in terms of the inflationary potential and its first and second derivatives. The comparison of the theory with each type of observation is described, starting with the COBE data and moving down in scale to the non-linear regime. Constraints on the spectrum of the adiabatic density perturbation are exhibited, the spectrum being parametrised by its normalisation and its degree of tilt. Finally extensions of the CDM model are considered, which replace some of the cold dark matter by hot dark matter or a cosmological constant.},

abstract = {We present XMM-Newton observations of the Chandra-detected nuclear X-ray source in NGC 4561. The hard X-ray spectrum can be described by a model composed of an absorbed power-law with Gamma= 2.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}, and column density N_H=1.9^{+0.1}_{-0.2} times 10^{22} atoms cm^{-2}. The absorption corrected luminosity of the source is L(0.2 - 10.0 keV) = 2.5 times 10^{41} ergs s^{-1}, with bolometric luminosity over 3 \times 10^{42} ergs s^{-1}. Based on the spectrum and the luminosity, we identify the nuclear X-ray source in NGC 4561 to be an AGN, with a black hole of mass M_BH > 20,000 solar masses. The presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of this bulge-less galaxy shows that black hole masses are not necessarily related to bulge properties, contrary to the general belief. Observations such as these call into question several theoretical models of BH--galaxy co-evolution that are based on merger-driven BH growth; secular processes clearly play an important role. Several emission lines are detected in the soft X-ray spectrum of the source which can be well parametrized by an absorbed diffuse thermal plasma with non-solar abundances of some heavy elements. Similar soft X-ray emission is observed in spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies and low luminosity AGNs, suggesting an origin in the circumnuclear plasma.},

abstract = {The Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) of the hot plasma spots or clumps orbiting an accreting black hole contain information on the black hole mass and spin. The promising observational signatures for the measurement of black hole mass and spin are the latitudinal oscillation frequency of the bright spots in the accretion flow and the frequency of black hole horizon rotation. Both of these frequencies are independent of the accretion model and defined completely by the properties of the black hole gravitational field. Interpretation of the known QPO data by dint of signal modulation from the hot spots in the accreting plasma reveals the Kerr metric rotation parameter, a=0.64+-0.05, of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center. At the same time, the observed 11.5 min QPO period is identified with the period of the black hole horizon rotation, and, respectively, the 19 min period is identified with the latitudinal oscillation period of hot spots in the accretion flow.},

SMBH population models, however, provide specific predictions for the properties of the gravitational-wave background (GWB) from binary SMBHs in merging galaxies throughout the universe.

abstract = {The capture and inspiral of compact stellar masses into massive black holes is an important source of low-frequency gravitational waves (with frequencies of $\sim$1-100mHz), such as those that might be detected by the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Simulations of stellar clusters designed to study this problem typically rely on simple treatments of the black hole encounter which neglect some important features of orbits around black holes, such as the minimum radii of stable, non-plunging orbits. Incorporating an accurate representation of the orbital dynamics near a black hole has been avoided due to the large computational overhead. This paper provides new, more accurate, expressions for the energy and angular momentum lost by a compact object during a parabolic encounter with a non-spinning black hole, and the subsequent inspiral lifetime. These results improve on the Keplerian expressions which are now commonly used and will allow efficient computational simulations to be performed that account for the relativistic nature of the spacetime around the central black hole in the system.},

abstract = {We observed Sgr A* and two extragalactic radio sources nearby in angle with the VLBA over a period of 2 yr and measured relative positions with an accuracy approaching 0.1 mas. The apparent proper motion of Sgr A* relative to J1745-283 is 5.90 ± 0.4 mas yr -1 , almost entirely in the plane of the Galaxy. The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this motion, and any residual proper motion of Sgr A*, with respect to extragalactic sources, is less than about 20 km s -1 . Assuming that Sgr A* is at rest at the center of the Galaxy, we estimate that the circular rotation speed in the Galaxy at the position of the Sun, $\Theta$ 0 , is 219 ± 20 km s -1 , scaled by R 0 /8.0 kpc. Current observations are consistent with Sgr A* containing all of the nearly 2.6 × 10 6 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} , deduced from stellar proper motions, in the form of a massive black hole.

The very slow speed of Sgr A* yields a lower limit to the mass of Sgr A* of about 1000 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} . Even for this mass, Sgr A* appears to be radiating at less than 0.1% of its Eddington limit.},

abstract = {Massive stars are essential to understand a variety of branches of astronomy including galaxy and star cluster evolution, nucleosynthesis and supernovae, pulsars and black holes. It has become evident that massive star evolution is very diverse, being sensitive to metallicity, binarity, rotation, and possibly magnetic fields. While the problem to obtain a good statistical observational database is alleviated by current large spectroscopic surveys, it remains a challenge to model these diverse paths of massive stars towards their violent end stage. We show that the main sequence stage offers the best opportunity to gauge the relevance of the various possible evolutionary scenarios. This also allows to sketch the post-main sequence evolution of massive stars, for which observations of Wolf-Rayet stars give essential clues. Recent supernova discoveries due to the current boost in transient searches allow tentative mappings of progenitor models with supernova types, including pair instability supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.},

abstract = {We study the formation of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary and the shrinking of the separation of the two holes to sub-pc scales starting from a realistic major merger between two gas-rich spiral galaxies with mass comparable to our Milky Way. The simulations are the first of this kind carried out with an Adaptive Mesh refinement (AMR) code (here RAMSES), and the first capable to resolve separations as small as 0.1 pc. The collision of the two galaxies produces a gravo-turbulent rotating nuclear disk with mass (\sim 10^9 Msun) and size (\sim 60 pc) in excellent agreement with previous SPH simulations with particle splitting that used a similar setup (Mayer et al. 2007) but were limited to separations of a few parsecs. The AMR results confirm that the two black holes sink rapidly as a result of dynamical friction onto the gaseous background, reaching a separation of 1 pc in less than 10^7 yr. We show that the dynamical friction wake is well resolved by our model and we find good agreement with analytical predictions of the drag force as a function of the Mach number. Below 1 pc, black hole pairing slows down significantly, as the relative velocity between the sinking SMBH becomes highly subsonic and the mass contained within their orbit falls below the mass of the binary itself, rendering dynamical friction ineffective. Non-axisymmetric gas torques do not arise to restart sinking in absence of efficient dynamical friction, at variance with previous calculations using idealized equilibrium nuclear disk models. We believe that the rather "hot" EOS we used to model the multiphase turbulent ISM in the nuclear region is playing an important role in preventing efficient SMBH sinking inside the central parsec. We conclude with a discussion of the way forward to address sinking in gaseous backgrounds at sub-pc scales approaching the gravitational wave regime.},

The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

For the quiescent galaxy sample, composed of 72 dynamical M_BH measurements, we update sigma for 28 galaxies using homogeneous H-band measurements that are corrected for galaxy rotation. For active galaxies, we collect 25 reverberation-mapped AGNs and improve sigma measurement for two objects . Combining the two samples, we determine the virial factor $f$, first by scaling the active galaxy sample to the M-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies, and second by simultaneously fitting the quiescent and active galaxy samples, as f=5.1_{-1.1}^{+1.5} and f=5.9_{-1.5}^{+2.1}, respectively. The M-sigma relation of active galaxies appears to be shallower than that of quiescent galaxies. However, the discrepancy is caused by a difference in the accessible M_BH distribution at given sigma, primarily due to the difficulty of measuring reliable stellar velocity dispersion for the host galaxies of luminous AGNs. Accounting for the selection effects, we find that active and quiescent galaxies are consistent with following intrinsically the same M-sigma relation.},

abstract = {A small mass particle traveling in a curved spacetime is known to trace a background geodesic in the lowest order approximation with respect to the particle mass. In this paper, we discuss the leading order correction to the equation of motion of the particle, which presumably describes the effect of gravitational radiation reaction. We derive the equation of motion in two different ways. The first one is an extension of the well-known formalism by DeWitt and Brehme developed for deriving the equation of motion of an electrically charged particle. Constructing the conserved rank-two symmetric tensor, and integrating it over the interior of the world tube surrounding the orbit, we derive the equation of motion. Although the calculation in this approach is straightforward, it contains less rigorous points. In contrast with the electromagnetic case, in which there are two different charges, i.e., the electric charge and the mass, the gravitational counterpart has only one charge. This fact prevents us from using the same renormalization scheme that was used in the electromagnetic case. In order to overcome this difficulty, we put an ansatz in evaluating the integral of the conserved tensor on a three spatial volume which defines the momentum of the small particle. To make clear the subtlety in the first approach, we then consider the asymptotic matching of two different schemes: i.e., the internal scheme in which the small particle is represented by a spherically symmetric black hole with tidal perturbations and the external scheme in which the metric is given by small perturbations on the given background geometry. The equation of motion is obtained from the consistency condition of the matching. We find that in both ways the same equation of motion is obtained. The resulting equation of motion is analogous to that derived in the electromagnetic case. We discuss implications of this equation of motion.},

abstract = {The choice of a suitable MCMC method and further the choice of a proposal distribution is known to be crucial for the convergence of the Markov chain. However, in many cases the choice of an effective proposal distribution is difficult. As a remedy we suggest a method called Adaptive Proposal (AP). Although the stationary distribution of the AP algorithm is slightly biased, it appears to provide an efficient tool for, e.g., reasonably low dimensional problems, as typically encountered in non-linear regression problems in natural sciences. As a realistic example we include a successful application of the AP algorithm in parameter estimation for the satellite instrument `GOMOS'. In this paper we also present systematic performance criteria for comparing Adaptive Proposal algorithm with more traditional Metropolis algorithms.},

(As in condensed-matter systems, z measures the degree of anisotropy between space and time.) This theory, which at short distances describes interacting nonrelativistic gravitons, is power-counting renormalizable in 3+1 dimensions. When restricted to satisfy the condition of detailed balance, this theory is intimately related to topologically massive gravity in three dimensions, and the geometry of the Cotton tensor. At long distances, this theory flows naturally to the relativistic value z=1, and could therefore serve as a possible candidate for a UV completion of Einstein’s general relativity or an infrared modification thereof. The effective speed of light, the Newton constant and the cosmological constant all emerge from relevant deformations of the deeply nonrelativistic z=3 theory at short distances.},

abstract = {We perform a Bayesian analysis of the mass distribution of stellar-mass black holes using the observed masses of 15 low-mass X-ray binary systems undergoing Roche lobe overflow and five high-mass, wind-fed X-ray binary systems. Using MCMC calculations, we model the mass distribution both parametrically---as a power law, exponential, gaussian, combination of two gaussians, or log-normal distribution---and non-parametrically---as histograms with varying numbers of bins. We provide confidence bounds on the shape of the mass distribution in the context of each model and compare the models by calculating their Bayesian evidence. The mass distribution of the low-mass systems is best fit by a power-law, while the distribution of the combined sample is best fit by the exponential model. This difference indicates that the low-mass subsample is not consistent with being drawn from the distribution of the combined population. We examine the existence of a ``gap'' between the most massive neutron stars and the least massive black holes by considering the 1% quantile from each black hole mass distribution, M_1%. The best model (the power law) fitted to the low-mass systems gives a distribution with M_1% > 4.3 MSun with 90% confidence, while the best model (the exponential) fitted to all 20 systems has M_1% > 4.5 MSun with 90% confidence. We conclude that our sample of black hole masses provides strong evidence of a gap between the maximum neutron star mass and the minimum black hole mass. Our results on the low-mass sample are in qualitative agreement with those of Ozel et al (2010), although our broad model-selection analysis more reliably reveals the best-fit underlying mass distribution. The presence of a mass gap remains theoretically unexplained.},

@article{Antonini2010,
abstract = {In Paper I, we followed the evolution of binary stars as they orbited near the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic center, noting the cases in which the two stars would come close enough together to collide. In this paper we replace the point-mass stars by fluid realizations, and use a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code to follow the close interactions. We model the binary components as main-sequence stars with initial masses of 1, 3 and 6 Solar masses, and with chemical composition profiles taken from stellar evolution codes. Outcomes of the close interactions include mergers, collisions that leave both stars intact, and ejection of one star at high velocity accompanied by capture of the other star into a tight orbit around the SMBH. For the first time, we follow the evolution of the collision products for many ($\gtrsim 100$) orbits around the SMBH. Stars that are initially too small to be tidally disrupted by the SMBH can be puffed up by close encounters or collisions, with the result that tidal stripping occurs in subsequent periapse passages. In these cases, mass loss occurs episodically, sometimes for hundreds of orbits before the star is completely disrupted. Repeated tidal flares, of either increasing or decreasing intensity, are a predicted consequence. In collisions involving a low-mass and a high-mass star, the merger product acquires a high core hydrogen abundance from the smaller star, effectively resetting the nuclear evolution "clock" to a younger age. Elements like Li, Be and B that can exist only in the outermost envelope of a star are severely depleted due to envelope ejection during collisions and due to tidal forces from the SMBH. In the absence of collisions, tidal spin-up of stars is only important in a narrow range of periapse distances, $r_t/2\lesssim r_per \lesssim r_t$ with $r_t$ the tidal disruption radius.},

We compare our NB results with those obtained by solving the orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck (FP) equation in energy space. The NB segregation is slightly stronger than in the FP solution, but both confirm the robustness of the regime of strong segregation when the number fraction of heavy stars is a (realistically) small fraction of the total population. In view of recent observations revealing a dearth of giant stars in the sub-parsec region of the Milky Way, we show that the timescales associated with cusp re-growth are not longer than (0.1 – 0.25) × T rlx ( r h ).

abstract = {According to general relativity, photons are deflected and delayed by the curvature of space-time produced by any mass. The bending and delay are proportional to gamma + 1, where the parameter gamma is unity in general relativity but zero in the newtonian model of gravity. The quantity gamma - 1 measures the degree to which gravity is not a purely geometric effect and is affected by other fields; such fields may have strongly influenced the early Universe, but would have now weakened so as to produce tiny--but still detectable--effects. Several experiments have confirmed to an accuracy of approximately 0.1% the predictions for the deflection and delay of photons produced by the Sun. Here we report a measurement of the frequency shift of radio photons to and from the Cassini spacecraft as they passed near the Sun. Our result, gamma = 1 + (2.1 +/- 2.3) x 10(-5), agrees with the predictions of standard general relativity with a sensitivity that approaches the level at which, theoretically, deviations are expected in some cosmological models.},

Gravitational waves from eccentric binaries can be regarded as a sequence of pulses, which are composed of various higher harmonic modes than ones with twice the orbital frequency. The higher harmonic modes from a very early inspiral phase will not only contribute to the signal-to-noise ratio, but also allow us to localize the gravitational-wave source before the merger sets in. This is due to the fact that high-frequency gravitational waves are essential for the source localization via triangulation by ground-based detector networks. We found that the one-detector signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 at 10 minutes before the merger for a $1.4 M_\odot$-$1.4 M_\odot$ eccentric binary neutron stars at 100 Mpc, and it can be localized up to 10 degree$^2$ at half a minute before the merger by a four-detector network.

However, these extreme mass-ratio inspiral sources began in long-period, nearly parabolic orbits that have multiple close encounters with the MBH. The gravitational radiation emitted during these close encounters may be detectable by LISA as a gravitational wave burst if the characteristic passage timescale is less than $10^5$ seconds. Scaling a static, spherical model to the size and mass of the Milky Way bulge we estimate an event rate of $\sim$ 15 per year for such burst signals, detectable by LISA with signal-to-noise greater than five, originating in our galaxy. When extended to include Virgo cluster galaxies our estimate increases to a gravitational wave burst rate of $\sim$ 18. We conclude that these extreme mass-ratio burst sources may be a steady and significant source of gravitational radiation in the LISA data streams.},

abstract = {Massive black holes (MBHs) in contrast to stellar mass black holes are expected to substantially change their properties over their lifetime. MBH masses increase by several order of magnitude over the Hubble time, as illustrated by Soltan's argument. MBH spins also must evolve through the series of accretion and mergers events that grow the MBH's masses. We present a simple model that traces the joint evolution of MBH masses and spins across cosmic time. Our model includes MBH-MBH mergers, merger-driven gas accretion, stochastic fueling of MBHs through molecular cloud capture, and a basic implementation of accretion of recycled gas. This approach aims at improving the modeling of low-redshift MBHs and AGN, whose properties can be more easily estimated observationally. Despite the simplicity of the model, it captures well the global evolution of the MBH population from z\sim6 to today. Under our assumptions, we find that the typical spin and radiative efficiency of MBHs decrease with cosmic time because of the higher incidence of stochastic processes in gas-rich galaxies and MBH-MBH mergers in gas-poor galaxies. At z=0 the spin distribution in gas-poor galaxies peaks at spins 0.4-0.8, and it is not strongly mass dependent. MBHs in gas-rich galaxies have a more complex evolution, with low-mass MBHs at low redshift having low spins, and spins increasing at larger masses and redshifts. We also find that at z>1 MBH spins are on average highest in high luminosity AGN, while at lower redshifts these differences disappear.},

abstract = {We present a method to integrate the equations of motion that govern bound, accelerated orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime. At each instant the true worldline is assumed to lie tangent to a reference geodesic, called an osculating orbit, such that the worldline evolves smoothly from one such geodesic to the next. Because a geodesic is uniquely identified by a set of constant orbital elements, the transition between osculating orbits corresponds to an evolution of the elements. In this paper we derive the evolution equations for a convenient set of orbital elements, assuming that the force acts only within the orbital plane; this is the only restriction that we impose on the formalism, and we do not assume that the force must be small. As an application of our method, we analyze the relative motion of two massive bodies, assuming that one body is much smaller than the other. Using the hybrid Schwarzschild/post-Newtonian equations of motion formulated by Kidder, Will, and Wiseman, we treat the unperturbed motion as geodesic in a Schwarzschild spacetime with a mass parameter equal to the system’s total mass. The force then consists of terms that depend on the system’s reduced mass. We highlight the importance of conservative terms in this force, which cause significant long-term changes in the time dependence and phase of the relative orbit. From our results we infer some general limitations of the radiative approximation to the gravitational self-force, which uses only the dissipative terms in the force.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the formation and dynamical evolution of black hole-black hole (BH-BH) binaries in young star clusters (YSCs), by means of N-body simulations. The simulations include metallicity-dependent recipes for stellar evolution and stellar winds, and have been run for three different metallicities (Z = 0.01, 0.1 and 1 Zsun). Following recent theoretical models of wind mass-loss and core-collapse supernovae, we assume that the mass of the stellar remnants depends on the metallicity of the progenitor stars. We find that BH-BH binaries form efficiently because of dynamical exchanges: in our simulations, we find about 10 times more BH-BH binaries than double neutron star binaries. The simulated BH-BH binaries form earlier in metal-poor YSCs, which host more massive black holes (BHs) than in metal-rich YSCs. The simulated BH-BH binaries have very large chirp masses (up to 80 Msun), because the BH mass is assumed to depend on metallicity, and because BHs can grow in mass due to the merger with stars. The simulated BH-BH binaries span a wide range of orbital periods (10^-3-10^7 yr), and only a small fraction of them (0.3 per cent) is expected to merge within a Hubble time. We discuss the estimated merger rate from our simulations and the implications for Advanced VIRGO and LIGO.},

abstract = {Theoretical studies in gravitational wave astronomy have mostly focused on the information that can be extracted from individual detections, such as the mass of a binary system and its location in space. Here we consider how the information from multiple detections can be used to constrain astrophysical population models. This seemingly simple problem is made challenging by the high dimensionality and high degree of correlation in the parameter spaces that describe the signals, and by the complexity of the astrophysical models, which can also depend on a large number of parameters, some of which might not be directly constrained by the observations. We present a method for constraining population models using a Hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach which simultaneously infers the source parameters and population model and provides the joint probability distributions for both. We illustrate this approach by considering the constraints that can be placed on population models for galactic white dwarf binaries using a future space based gravitational wave detector. We find that a mission that is able to resolve $\sim$5000 of the shortest period binaries will be able to constrain the population model parameters, including the chirp mass distribution and a characteristic galaxy disk radius to within a few percent. This compares favorably to existing bounds, where electromagnetic observations of stars in the galaxy constrain disk radii to within 20%.},

abstract = {For a general class of analytic $f(R,R_{\alpha\beta}R^{\alpha\beta},R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}R^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta})$ we discuss the gravitational lensing in the Newtonian Limit of theory. From the properties of Gauss Bonnet invariant it is successful to consider only two curvature invariants between the Ricci and Riemann tensor. Then we analyze the dynamics of photon embedded in a gravitational field of a generic $f(R,R_{\alpha\beta}R^{\alpha\beta})$-Gravity. The metric is time independent and spherically symmetric. The metric potentials are Schwarzschild-like, but there are two additional Yukawa terms linked to derivatives of $f$ with respect to two curvature invariants. Considering the case of a point-like lens, and after of a generic matter distribution of lens, we study the deflection angle and the images angular position. Though the additional Yukawa terms in the gravitational potential modifies dynamics with respect to General Relativity, the geodesic trajectory of photon is unaffected by the modification in the action by only $f(R)$. While we find different results (deflection angle smaller than one of General Relativity) only thank to introduction of a generic function of Ricci tensor square. Finally we can affirm the lensing phenomena for all $f(R)$-Gravities are equal to the ones known from General Relativity. We conclude the paper showing and comparing the deflection angle and image positions for $f(R,R_{\alpha\beta}R^{\alpha\beta})$-Gravity with respect to ones of General Relativity.},

abstract = {Pulsar timing experiments aimed at the detection of gravitational radiation have been performed for decades now. With the forthcoming construction of large arrays capable of tracking multiple millisecond pulsars, it is very likely we will be able to make the first detection of gravitational radiation in the nano-Hertz band, and test Einstein’s theory of relativity by measuring the polarization components of the detected signals. Since a gravitational wave predicted by the most general relativistic metric theory of gravity accounts for six polarization modes (the usual two Einstein’s tensor polarizations as well as two vector and two scalar wave components), we have estimated the single-antenna sensitivities to these six polarizations. We find pulsar timing experiments to be significantly more sensitive, over their entire observational frequency band (≈10-9-10-6Hz), to scalar-longitudinal and vector waves than to scalar-transverse and tensor waves. At 10-7Hz and with pulsars at a distance of 1 kpc, for instance, we estimate an average sensitivity to scalar-longitudinal waves that is more than two orders of magnitude better than the sensitivity to tensor waves. Our results imply that a direct detection of gravitational radiation by pulsar timing will result into a test of the theory of general relativity that is more stringent than that based on monitoring the decay of the orbital period of a binary system.},

@article{Ellis2013a,
abstract = {This paper argues that the effect of Hawking radiation on an astrophysical black hole is not total evaporation of the black hole; rather there will always be a remnant. The key point is that the locus of emission of Hawking radiation is not the globally defined event horizon, but rather is just outside a timelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined and lies inside the event horizon, close to the collapsing star. A spacelike singularity forms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at this singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches infinity depends on the relation between the dynamic radiation emission surface and the event horizon, which is affected both by Cosmic Background Radiation and by back-reaction due to the Hawking radiation. From the outside view, even if radiation is seen as always being emitted, the black hole never evaporates away, rather its mass and entropy asymptote to finite non-zero limits. The argument is based on the broad nature of the processes at work, plus a careful delineation of the relevant causal domains; detailed calculations of back reaction effects are necessary in order to confirm this model and determine details of the outcome.},

abstract = {Few topics in astronomy initiate such vigorous discussion as whether or not the initial mass function (IMF) of stars is universal, or instead sensitive to the initial conditions of star formation. The distinction is of critical importance: the IMF influences most of the observable properties of stellar populations and galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide deep insights into the process by which stars form. In this review, we take a critical look at the case for IMF variations, with a view towards whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, local young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a "universal" IMF: a power-law of Salpeter index ($\Gamma=1.35$) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power-law ($\Gamma \sim 0-0.25$) between a few tenths and a few solar masses (ignoring the effects of unresolved binaries). The shape and universality of the IMF at the stellar-substellar boundary is still under investigation and uncertainties remain large, but most observations are consistent with a IMF that declines ($\Gamma < -0.5$) well below the hydrogen burning limit. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a "universal IMF", suggesting no gross variations in the IMF over much of cosmic time. There are indications of "non-standard" IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments, which clearly warrant further study. Nonetheless, there is no clear evidence that the IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the existence of an enhanced rate of angular momentum relaxation in nearly Keplerian star clusters, such as those found in the centers of galactic nuclei containing massive black holes. The enhanced relaxation arises because the radial and azimuthal orbital frequencies in a Keplerian potential are equal, and hence may be termed {\em resonant relaxation}. We explore the dynamics of resonant relaxation using both numerical simulations and order-of-magnitude analytic calculations. We find that the resonant angular momentum relaxation time is shorter than the non-resonant relaxation time by of order $M_\star/M$, where $M_\star$ is the mass in stars and $M$ is the mass of the central object. Resonance does not enhance the energy relaxation rate. We examine the effect of resonant relaxation on the rate of tidal disruption of stars by the central mass; we find that the flux of stars into the loss cone is enhanced when the loss cone is empty, but that the disruption rate averaged over the entire cluster is not strongly affected. We show that relativistic precession can disable resonant relaxation near the main-sequence loss cone for black hole masses comparable to those in galactic nuclei. Resonant dynamical friction leads to growth or decay of the eccentricity of the orbit of a massive body, depending on whether the distribution function of the stars is predominantly radial or tangential.

abstract = {We describe early success in the evolution of binary black-hole spacetimes with a numerical code based on a generalization of harmonic coordinates. Indications are that with sufficient resolution this scheme is capable of evolving binary systems for enough time to extract information about the orbit, merger, and gravitational waves emitted during the event. As an example we show results from the evolution of a binary composed of two equal mass, nonspinning black holes, through a single plunge orbit, merger, and ringdown. The resultant black hole is estimated to be a Kerr black hole with angular momentum parameter a≈0.70. At present, lack of resolution far from the binary prevents an accurate estimate of the energy emitted, though a rough calculation suggests on the order of 5% of the initial rest mass of the system is radiated as gravitational waves during the final orbit and ringdown.},

abstract = {Massive black hole binary systems, with masses in the range $\sim$10^4-10^10 \msun, are among the primary sources of gravitational waves in the frequency window $\sim$10^-9 Hz - 0.1 Hz. Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are the observational means by which we will be able to observe gravitational radiation from these systems. We carry out a systematic study of the generation of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from the cosmic population of massive black hole binaries. We consider a wide variety of assembly scenarios and we estimate the range of signal strength in the frequency band accessible to PTAs. We show that, taking into account the uncertainties surrounding the actual key model parameters, the amplitude lies in the interval h_c(f = 10^-8 Hz)$\sim$5x10^-16 - 8x10^-15. The most optimistic predictions place the signal level at a factor of $\sim$3 below the current sensitivity of Pulsar Timing Arrays, but within the detection range of the complete Parkes PTA for a wide variety of models, and of the future Square-Kilometer-Array PTA for all the models considered here. We also show that at frequencies >10^-8 Hz the frequency dependency of the generated background follows a power-law significantly steeper than f^-2/3, that has been considered so far. Finally we show that LISA observations of individual resolvable massive black hole binaries are complementary and orthogonal to PTA observations of a stochastic background from the whole population in the Universe. In fact, the detection of gravitational radiation in both frequency windows will enable us to fully characterise the cosmic history of massive black holes.},

abstract = {Stellar dynamical modeling is a powerful method to determine the mass of black holes in quiescent galaxies. However, in previous work the presence of a dark matter halo has been ignored in the modeling. Gebhardt & Thomas (2009) showed that accounting for a dark matter halo increased the black-hole mass of the massive galaxy M87 by a factor of 2. We used a sample of 12 galaxies to investigate the effect of accounting for a dark matter halo in the dynamical modeling in more detail, and also updated the masses using improved modeling. The sample of galaxies possess HST and ground based observations of stellar kinematics. Their black-hole masses have been presented before, but without including a dark matter halo in the models. Without a dark halo, we find a mean increase in the estimated mass of 1.5 for the whole sample compared to previous results. We attribute this change to using a more complete orbit library. When we include a dark matter halo, along with the updated models, we find an additional increase in black-hole mass by a factor of 1.2 in the mean, much less than for M87. We attribute the smaller discrepancy in black-hole mass to using data that better resolves the black hole's sphere of influence. We redetermined the M-sigma and M-L relationships using our updated black-hole masses and find a slight increase in both normalization and intrinsic scatter.},

abstract = {As massive black holes (MBHs) grow from lower-mass seeds, it is natural to expect that a leftover population of progenitor MBHs should also exist in the present universe. Dwarf galaxies undergo a quiet merger history, and as a result, we expect that dwarfs observed in the local Universe retain some `memory' of the original seed mass distribution. Consequently, the properties of MBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies may provide clean indicators of the efficiency of MBH formation. In order to examine the properties of MBHs in dwarf galaxies, we evolve different MBH populations within a Milky Way halo from high-redshift to today. We consider two plausible MBH formation mechanisms: `massive seeds' formed via gas-dynamical instabilities and a Population III remnant seed model. `Massive seeds' have larger masses than PopIII remnants, but form in rarer hosts. We dynamically evolve all halos merging with the central system, taking into consideration how the interaction modifies the satellites, stripping their outer mass layers. We compute different properties of the MBH population hosted in these satellites. We find that for the most part MBHs retain the original mass, thus providing a clear indication of what the properties of the seeds were. We derive the black hole occupation fraction (BHOF) of the satellite population at z=0. MBHs generated as `massive seeds' have large masses that would favour their identification, but their typical BHOF is always below 40 per cent and decreases to less than per cent for observed dwarf galaxy sizes. In contrast, Population III remnants have a higher BHOF, but their masses have not grown much since formation, inhibiting their detection.},

abstract = {We present a generic criterion which can be used in gravitational-wave data analysis to distinguish an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral into a Kerr background spacetime from one into a non-Kerr background spacetime. The criterion exploits the fact that when an integrable system, such as the system that describes geodesic orbits in a Kerr spacetime, is perturbed, the tori in phase space which initially corresponded to resonances disintegrate so as to form the so called Birkhoff chains on a surface of section, according to the Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff theorem. The KAM curves of these islands in such a chain share the same ratio of frequencies, even though the frequencies themselves vary from one KAM curve to another inside an island. On the other hand, the KAM curves, which do not lie in a Birkhoff chain, do not share this characteristic property. Such a temporal constancy of the ratio of frequencies during the evolution of the gravitational-wave signal will signal a non-Kerr spacetime which could then be further explored.},

The white dwarf matter overflows the Roche lobe through the L1 point at each pericentre passage and the mass-loss repeats periodically. The process occurs very close to the black hole and the released gas can accrete, creating a bright source of radiation with luminosity close to the Eddington limit, L $\sim$ 1043ergs-1.

abstract = {Physics invites the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein's cosmological constant, Lambda; nowadays the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests the dark energy could be dynamical, allowing the arguably appealing picture that the dark energy density is evolving to its natural value, zero, and is small now because the expanding universe is old. This alleviates the classical problem of the curious energy scale of order a millielectronvolt associated with a constant Lambda. Dark energy may have been detected by recent advances in the cosmological tests. The tests establish a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaitre model, including the gravitational inverse square law applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one quarter of the critical Einstein-de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is serious but not yet as convincing; we await more checks that may come out of work in progress. Planned observations might be capable of detecting evolution of the dark energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus to attempts to understand the microphysics of dark energy. This review presents the basic physics and astronomy of the subject, reviews the history of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence, and comments on recent developments in the search for a fundamental theory.},

A complete picture involving all of the black hole scaling relations, in which each relation is consistent with the others, is necessary to fully understand the black hole-galaxy connection. The relation between M_BH and the central light concentration of the surrounding bulge, quantified by the S\'ersic index n, may be one of the simplest and strongest such relations, requiring only uncalibrated galaxy images. We have conducted a census of literature S\'ersic index measurements for a sample of 54 local galaxies with directly measured M_BH values. We find a clear M_BH - n relation, despite an appreciable level of scatter due to the heterogeneity of the data. Given the current M_BH - L_sph and the L_sph - n relations, we have additionally derived the expected M_BH - n relations, which are marginally consistent at the 2 sigma level with the observed relations. Elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies are each expected to follow two distinct bent M_BH - n relations due to the S\'ersic/core-S\'ersic divide. For the same central light concentration, we predict that M_BH in the S\'ersic bulges of disc galaxies are an order magnitude higher than in S\'ersic elliptical galaxies if they follow the same M_BH - L_sph relation.},

The theory is identical to one in which the embedding coordinate is itself a dynamical variable, rather than a fixed, external quantity. Consequently diffeomorphism symmetry breaking is hidden in the modified theory: the Schwarzschild metric is a solution; gravitational waves possess two polarizations, each traveling at the velocity of light; a conserved energy-momentum (pseudo-) tensor can be constructed. The modification is visible in the intensity of gravitational radiation: the two polarizations of a gravity wave carry intensities that are suppressed/enchanced by the extension.},

abstract = {Numerical relativity simulations predict that coalescence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries not only leads to a spin flip but also to a recoiling of the merger remnant SMBHs. In the literature, X-shaped radio sources are popularly suggested to be candidates for SMBH mergers with spin flip of jet-ejecting SMBHs. Here we investigate the spectral and spatial observational signatures of the recoiling SMBHs in radio sources undergoing black hole spin flip. Our results show that SMBHs in most spin-flip radio sources have mass ratio $q\ga 0.3$ with a minimum possible value $q_{\rm min} \simeq 0.05$. For major mergers, the remnant SMBHs can get a kick velocity as high as $2100 km s^{-1}$ in the direction within an angle $\la 40^\circ$ relative to the spin axes of remnant SMBHs, implying that recoiling quasars are biased to be with high Doppler-shifted broad emission lines while recoiling radio galaxies are biased to large apparent spatial off-center displacements. We also calculate the distribution functions of line-of-sight velocity and apparent spatial off-center for spin-flip radio sources with different apparent jet reorientation angles. Our results show that the larger the apparent jet reorientation angle is, the larger the Doppler-shifting recoiling velocity and apparent spatial off-center displacement will be. We investigate the effects of recoiling velocity on the dust torus in spin-flip radio sources and suggest that recoiling of SMBHs would lead to "dust poor" AGNs. Finally, we collect a sample of 19 X-shaped radio objects and for each object give the probability of detecting the predicted signatures of recoiling SMBH.},

abstract = {Under the assumption that astrophysical black hole candidates are the Kerr black holes of general relativity, the continuum-fitting method and the analysis of the K$\alpha$ iron line are today the only available techniques capable of providing a relatively reliable estimate of the spin parameter of these objects. If we relax the Kerr black hole hypothesis and we try to test the nature of black hole candidates, we find that there is a strong correlation between the measurement of the spin and possible deviations from the Kerr solution. The properties of the radiation emitted in a Kerr spacetime with spin parameter $a_*$ are indeed very similar, and practically indistinguishable, from the ones of the radiation emitted around a non-Kerr object with different spin. In this paper, I address the question whether measuring the Kerr spin with both the continuum-fitting method and the K$\alpha$ iron line analysis of the same object can be used to claim the Kerr nature of the black hole candidate in the case of consistent results. The answer is more likely negative: if the object is not a Kerr black hole but we assume it is, the two techniques may anyway provide a very similar result.},

abstract = {A new formulation of Carter's constant for geodesic motion in Kerr black holes is given. It is shown that Carter's constant corresponds to the total angular momentum plus a precisely defined part which is quadratic in the linear momenta. The characterization is exact in the weak field limit obtained by letting the gravitational constant go to zero. It is suggested that the new form can be useful in current studies of the dynamics of extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems emitting gravitational radiation.},

abstract = {We present the highly significant detection of a quasi-periodic fbx modulation with a period of 22.2min seen in the X-ray data of the Sgr A* flare of 2004 August 31. This flaring event, which lasted a total of about three hours, was detected simultaneously by EPIC on XMM - Newton and the NICMOS near-infrared camera on the HST. Given the inherent difficulty in, and the lack of readily available methods for quantifying the probability of a periodic signal detected over only several cycles in a data set where red noise can be important, we developed a general method for quantifying the likelihood that such a modulation is indeed intrinsic to the source and does not arise from background fluctuations. We here describe this Monte Carlo based method, and discuss the results obtained by its application to other XMM - Newton data sets. Under the simplest hypothesis that we witnessed a transient event that evolved, peaked and decayed near the marginally stable orbit of the supermassive black hole, this result implies that for a mass of 3.5 × 10 6 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/doto.gif] {dot o} , the central object must have an angular momentum corresponding to a spin parameter of a ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/approx.gif] {approx} 0.22.},

abstract = {Einstein's equations for the orbits round an attracting point mass, here called the sun, are examined so as to see whether there are orbits which end in the sun, as there are in the corresponding case of electrical attraction when relativity is allowed for. With the measure of the radius as usually taken, it is shown that no hyperbolic orbit can have perihelion inside r = 3m, and an elliptic orbit cannot have perihelion inside r = 4m. Particles going inside these distances will be captured. Circular orbits are possible for any greater radius. If 3m<r<4m the orbit is unstable; with one disturbance it falls into the sun, with the opposite it escapes in a spiral to infinity. If 4m<r<6m, it is also unstable, either falling into the sun, or moving out to some aphelion at a greater radius before returning to its circle. Only if r>6m is the orbit stable. A study is made of the travel of light rays. No light ray from infinity can escape capture unless its initial asymptotic distance is greater than 3[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">3 m. A field of stars surrounds the sun, and is viewed in a telescope pointed at the sun from a distance.

abstract = {The polarized thermal emission from Galactic dust is the main foreground present in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at frequencies above 100GHz. We exploit the Planck HFI polarization data from 100 to 353GHz to measure the dust angular power spectra $C_\ell^{EE,BB}$ over the range $40<\ell<600$. These will bring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determination of the level of contamination for CMB polarization experiments. We show that statistical properties of the emission can be characterized over large fractions of the sky using $C_\ell$. For the dust, they are well described by power laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{EE,BB}=-2.42\pm0.02$. The amplitudes of the polarization $C_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in a way similar to the intensity ones. The dust polarization frequency dependence is consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and $T_d=19.6$K. We find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the Galactic $B$- and $E$-modes of 0.5. We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting regions there are no "clean" windows where primordial CMB $B$-mode polarization could be measured without subtraction of dust emission. Finally, we investigate the level of dust polarization in the BICEP2 experiment field. Extrapolation of the Planck 353GHz data to 150GHz gives a dust power $\ell(\ell+1)C_\ell^{BB}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$K$_{CMB}^2$ over the $40<\ell<120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is an additional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the same units. This is the same magnitude as reported by BICEP2 over this $\ell$ range, which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal. The present uncertainties will be reduced through an ongoing, joint analysis of the Planck and BICEP2 data sets.},

abstract = {One of the main bottlenecks in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy is the high cost of performing parameter estimation and GW searches on the fly. We propose a novel technique based on Reduced Order Quadratures (ROQs), an application and data-specific quadrature rule, to perform fast and accurate likelihood evaluations. These are the dominant cost in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which are widely employed in parameter estimation studies, and so ROQs offer a new way to accelerate GW parameter estimation. We illustrate our approach using a four dimensional GW burst model embedded in noise. We build an ROQ for this model, and perform four dimensional MCMC searches with both the standard and ROQs quadrature rules, showing that, for this model, the ROQ approach is around 25 times faster than the standard approach with essentially no loss of accuracy. The speed-up from using ROQs is expected to increase for more complex GW signal models and therefore has significant potential to accelerate parameter estimation of GW sources such as compact binary coalescences.},

abstract = {Space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA or a similar ESA-led mission, will offer unique opportunities to test general relativity. We study the bounds that space-based detectors could place on the graviton Compton wavelength \lambda_g=h/(m_g c) by observing multiple inspiralling black hole binaries. We show that while observations of individual inspirals will yield mean bounds \lambda_g$\sim$3x10^15 km, the combined bound from observing $\sim$50 events in a two-year mission is about ten times better: \lambda_g$\sim$3x10^16 km (m_g$\sim$4x10^-26 eV). The bound improves faster than the square root of the number of observed events, because typically a few sources provide constraints as much as three times better than the mean. This result is only mildly dependent on details of black hole formation and detector characteristics. The bound achievable in practice should be one order of magnitude better than this figure (and hence almost competitive with the static, model-dependent bounds from gravitational effects on cosmological scales), because our calculations ignore the merger/ringdown portion of the waveform.

abstract = {The presence of a nearby companion alters the evolution of massive stars in binary systems, leading to phenomena such as stellar mergers, x-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts. Unambiguous constraints on the fraction of massive stars affected by binary interaction were lacking. We simultaneously measured all relevant binary characteristics in a sample of Galactic massive O stars and quantified the frequency and nature of binary interactions. More than 70% of all massive stars will exchange mass with a companion, leading to a binary merger in one-third of the cases. These numbers greatly exceed previous estimates and imply that binary interaction dominates the evolution of massive stars, with implications for populations of massive stars and their supernovae.},

@article{Ozel2010,
abstract = {We use the dynamical mass measurements of 16 black holes in low-mass X-ray binaries to infer the stellar black hole mass distribution. We find that the observations are best described by a narrow mass distribution at 7.8 +/- 1.2 Msolar. We identify a selection effect related to the choice of targets for optical follow-ups that results in a flux-limited sample. We demonstrate, however, that this selection effect does not introduce a bias in the observed distribution and cannot explain the absence of black holes in the 2-5 solar mass range. On the high mass end, we argue that the rapid decline in the inferred distribution may be the result of the particular evolutionary channel followed by low-mass X-ray binaries. This is consistent with the presence of high-mass black holes in the persistent, high-mass X-ray binary sources. If the paucity of low-mass black holes is caused by a sudden decrease of the supernova explosion energy with increasing progenitor mass, this would have observable implications for ongoing transient surveys that target core-collapse supernovae. Our results also have significant implications for the calculation of event rates from the coalescence of black hole binaries for gravitational wave detectors.},

@article{Timmes1996,
abstract = {Using recently calculated models for massive stellar evolution and supernovae coupled to a model for Galactic chemical evolution, neutron star and black hole birth functions (number of neutron stars and black holes as a function of their mass) are determined for the Milky Way galaxy. For those stars that explode as Type II supernovae, the models give birth functions that are bimodal with peaks at 1.27 and 1.76 Msun and average masses within those peaks of 1.28 and 1.73 M0. For these stars that explode as Type Ib there is a narrower spread of remnant masses, the average being 1.32 Msun, and less evidence for bimodality. These values will be increased, especially in the more massive Type II supernovae, if significant accretion continues during the initial launching of the shock, and the number of heavier neutron stars could be depleted by black hole formation. The principal reason for the dichotomy in remnant masses for Type II is the difference in the presupernova structure of stars above and below 19 Msun, the mass separating stars that burn carbon convectively from those that produce less carbon and burn radiatively. The Type Ib's and the lower mass group of the Type II's compare favorably with measured neutron star masses, and in particular to the Thorsett et al. (1993) determination of the average neutron star mass in 17 systems 1.35±0.27 Msun. Variations in the exponent of a Salpeter initial mass function are shown not to affect the locations of the two peaks in the distribution function, but do affect their relative amplitudes. Sources of uncertainty, in particular placement of the mass cut and sensitivity to the explosion energy, are discussed, and estimates of the total number of neutron stars and black holes in the Galaxy are given. Accretion-induced collapse should give a unique gravitational mass of 1.27 Msun, although this could increase if accretion onto the newly formed star continues. A similar mass will typify stars in the 8-11 Msun range (e.g., the Crab pulsar). The lightest neutron star produced is 1.15 Msun for the Type II models and 1.22 Msun for the Type Ib models. Altogether there are about 109 neutron stars in our Galaxy and a comparable number of black holes.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of compact remnants (CRs) into massive black holes (MBHs) will be observable to cosmological distances. While a CR spirals in, two-body scattering by field stars may cause it to fall into the central MBH before reaching a short-period orbit that would give an observable signal. As a result, only CRs very near ($\sim$0.01 pc) the MBH can spiral in successfully. In a multimass stellar population, the heaviest objects sink to the center, where they are more likely to slowly spiral into the MBH without being swallowed prematurely. We study how mass segregation modifies the stellar distribution and the rate of GW events. We find that the inspiral rate per galaxy is 30 Gyr -1 for white dwarfs, 6 Gyr -1 for neutron stars, and 250 Gyr -1 for 10 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} stellar black holes (SBHs).

abstract = {The ESA's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe, was launched on May 2009 and has been surveying the microwave and submillimetre sky since August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration publicly released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck operations, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper describes the mission and its performance, and gives an overview of the processing and analysis of the data, the characteristics of the data, the main scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. Scientific results include robust support for the standard, six parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements for the parameters that define this model, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for some of these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large scale anomalies in the CMB temperature distribution detected earlier by WMAP are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at 25 sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussian statistics of the CMB anisotropies. There is some tension between Planck and WMAP results; this is evident in the power spectrum and results for some of the cosmology parameters. In general, Planck results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Because the analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet as mature as the analysis of temperature data, polarization results are not released. We do, however, illustrate the robust detection of the E-mode polarization signal around CMB hot- and cold-spots.},

abstract = {The growth of supermassive black holes appears to be driven by both galaxy mergers and `secular' processes that occur in their absence. In order to quantify the effects of secular evolution on black hole growth, we require a sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies that have formed without significant mergers, a population that heretofore has been difficult to locate. Here we present an initial sample of 13 AGN in massive (M_* \gtrsim 1e10 M_sun) bulgeless galaxies -- which lack the classical bulges believed inevitably to result from mergers -- selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using visual classifications from Galaxy Zoo. Parametric morphological fitting confirms the host galaxies lack classical bulges; any contributions from pseudobulges are very small (typically < 5%). This is the largest such sample yet assembled. We compute black hole masses for the two broad-line objects in the sample (4.2e6 and 1.2e7 M_sun) and place lower limits on black hole masses for the remaining sample (typically M_BH \gtrsim 1e6 M_sun), showing that significant black hole growth must be possible in the absence of mergers. The black hole masses are systematically higher than expected from established bulge-black hole relations. However, if the mean Eddington ratio of the systems with measured black hole masses (L/L_Edd \approx 0.065) is typical, 10 of 13 sources are consistent with the correlation between black hole mass and total stellar mass. That pure disk galaxies and their central black holes may be consistent with a relation derived from elliptical and bulge-dominated galaxies with very different formation histories implies the details of stellar galaxy evolution and dynamics may not be fundamental to the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes.},

Further analysis of existing data could tighten these limits; they will also improve as the time-base T lengthens. The orbital period of the binary pulsar provides a 'clock' whose intrinsic secular behaviour can be predicted, on the basis of general relativity, with an accuracy ≡10-11 yr-1. Searches for disparities between the predicted and measured changes in the orbit could, within a few years, probe the gravitational wave background at periods to ≡104 yr with a sensitivity corresponding to $\Omega$g ≅ 10-4.},

@article{McAlpine2011,
abstract = {The vast majority of optically identified active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe reside in host galaxies with prominent bulges, supporting the hypothesis that black hole formation and growth is fundamentally connected to the buildup of galaxy bulges. However, recent mid-infrared spectroscopic studies with Spitzer of a sample of optically "normal" late-type galaxies reveal, remarkably, the presence of high-ionization [Ne V] lines in several sources, providing strong evidence for AGNs in these galaxies. We present follow-up X-ray observations recently obtained with XMM-Newton of two such sources, the late-type optically normal galaxies NGC 3367 and NGC 4536. Both sources are detected in our observations. Detailed spectral analysis reveals that for both galaxies, the 2-10 keV emission is dominated by a power law with an X-ray luminosity in the L 2-10 keV $\sim$ 1039-1040 erg s-1 range, consistent with low-luminosity AGNs. While there is a possibility that X-ray binaries account for some fraction of the observed X-ray luminosity, we argue that this fraction is negligible. These observations therefore add to the growing evidence that the fraction of late-type galaxies hosting AGNs is significantly underestimated using optical observations alone. A comparison of the mid-infrared [Ne V] luminosity and the X-ray luminosities suggests the presence of an additional highly absorbed X-ray source in both galaxies, and that the black hole masses are in the range 105-107 M sun for NGC 3367 and 104-106 M sun for NGC 4536.},

Recent models suggest that the collapse of a supermassive star is likely to produce a black hole with j$\sim$0.7. (2) Major mergers. The outcome of a nearly equal mass black hole-black hole merger is not yet known, but we review the current best guesses and analytic bounds. (3) Minor mergers. We recover the result of Blandford &amp; Hughes that accretion of small companions with isotropically distributed orbital angular momenta results in spin-down, with j$\sim$M-7/3. (4) Accretion. We present new results from fully relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion simulations. These show that, at least for one sequence of flow models, spin equilibrium (dj/dt=0) is reached for j$\sim$0.9, far less than the canonical value 0.998 of Thorne that was derived in the absence of MHD effects. This equilibrium value may be inapplicable to some accretion flows, particularly thin disks. Nevertheless, it opens the possibility that black holes that have grown primarily through accretion are not maximally rotating.},

This allows us to study the mass and spin evolution of massive black holes in a self-consistent way, by taking into account the effect of the gas present in galactic nuclei both during the accretion phases and during mergers. Also, we present predictions, as a function of redshift, for the fraction of gas-rich black-hole mergers -- in which the spins prior to the merger are aligned due to the gravito-magnetic torques exerted by the circumbinary disk -- as opposed to gas-poor mergers, in which the orientation of the spins before the merger is roughly isotropic. These predictions may be tested by LISA or similar spaced-based gravitational-wave detectors such as eLISA/NGO or SGO.},

abstract = {The direct observation of gravitational waves (GW) in the near future, and the corresponding determination of the number of independent polarizations, is a powerful tool to test general relativity and alternative theories of gravity. In the present work we use the Newman–Penrose formalism to characterize GWs in quadratic gravity and in a particular class of f(R) Lagrangians. We find that both quadratic gravity and the f(R) theory belong to the most general invariant class of GWs, i.e., they can present up to six independent polarizations of GWs. For a particular combination of the parameters, we find that quadratic gravity can present up to five polarizations states. On the other hand, if we use the Palatini approach for f(R) theories, GWs present only the usual two transverse-traceless polarizations such as in general relativity. Thus, we conclude that the observation of GWs can strongly constrain the suitable formalism for these theories.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of a neutron star (NS) or stellar-mass black hole (BH) into an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with mass -->M $\sim$ 50–350 M☉ may be detectable by the planned advanced generation of ground-based GW interferometers. Such intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. We analyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH or BH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonance in a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of a CO from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discuss tidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS. For each mechanism we predict the typical eccentricities of the resulting IMRIs. We find that IMRIs will have largely circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of ground-based detectors. Hardening of a binary via three-body interactions, which is likely to be the dominant mechanism for IMRI formation, yields eccentricities under 10−4 when the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. Even among IMRIs formed via direct captures, which can have the highest eccentricities, around 90% will circularize to eccentricities under 0.1 before the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. We estimate the rate of IMRI coalescences in globular clusters and the sensitivity of a network of three Advanced LIGO detectors to the resulting GWs. We show that this detector network may see up to tens of IMRIs per year, although rates of one to a few per year may be more plausible. We also estimate the loss in signal-to-noise ratio that will result from using circular IMRI templates for data analysis and find that, for the eccentricities we expect, this loss is negligible.},

abstract = {Powerful telescopes equipped with multi-fibre or integral field spectrographs combined with detailed models of stellar atmospheres and automated fitting techniques allow for the analysis of large number of stars. These datasets contain a wealth of information that require new analysis techniques to bridge the gap between observations and stellar evolution models. To that end, we develop BONNSAI (BONN Stellar Astrophysics Interface), a Bayesian statistical method, that is capable of comparing all available observables simultaneously to stellar models while taking observed uncertainties and prior knowledge such as initial mass functions and distributions of stellar rotational velocities into account. BONNSAI can be used to (1) determine probability distributions of fundamental stellar parameters such as initial masses and stellar ages from complex datasets, (2) predict stellar parameters that were not yet observationally determined and (3) test stellar models to further advance our understanding of stellar evolution. An important aspect of BONNSAI is that it singles out stars that cannot be reproduced by stellar models through $\chi^{2}$ hypothesis tests and posterior predictive checks. BONNSAI can be used with any set of stellar models and currently supports massive main-sequence single star models of Milky Way and Large and Small Magellanic Cloud composition. We apply our new method to mock stars to demonstrate its functionality and capabilities. In a first application, we use BONNSAI to test the stellar models of Brott et al. (2011a) by comparing the stellar ages inferred for the primary and secondary stars of eclipsing Milky Way binaries. Ages are determined from dynamical masses and radii that are known to better than 3%. We find that the stellar models reproduce the Milky Way binaries well.

abstract = {The shearing sheet is a model dynamical system that is used to study the small-scale dynamics of astrophysical disks. Numerical simulations of particle trajectories in the shearing sheet usually employ the leapfrog integrator, but this integrator performs poorly because of velocity-dependent (Coriolis) forces. We describe two new integrators for this purpose; both are symplectic, time-reversible and second-order accurate, and can easily be generalized to higher orders. Moreover, both integrators are exact when there are no small-scale forces such as mutual gravitational forces between disk particles. In numerical experiments these integrators have errors that are often several orders of magnitude smaller than competing methods. The first of our new integrators (SEI) is well-suited for disks in which the typical inter-particle separation is large compared to the particles' Hill radii (e.g., planetary rings), and the second (SEKI) is designed for disks in which the particles are on bound orbits or the separation is smaller than the Hill radius (e.g., irregular satellites of the giant planets).},

@article{Heger2002,
abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have been quite massive ($\sim$100-300 Msolar). Could these stars have left a distinct nucleosynthetic signature? We explore the nucleosynthesis of helium cores in the mass range MHe=64-133 Msolar, corresponding to main-sequence star masses of approximately 140-260 Msolar. Above MHe=133 Msolar, without rotation and using current reaction rates, a black hole is formed, and no nucleosynthesis is ejected. For lighter helium core masses, $\sim$40-63 Msolar, violent pulsations occur, induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass ejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to a black hole, thus cleanly separating the heavy-element nucleosynthesis of pair instability supernovae from those of other masses, both above and below. Indeed, black hole formation is a likely outcome for all Population III stars with main-sequence masses between about 25 and 140 Msolar (MHe=9-63 Msolar) as well as those above 260 Msolar. Nucleosynthesis in pair instability supernovae varies greatly with the mass of the helium core. This core determines the maximum temperature reached during the bounce. At the upper range of exploding core masses, a maximum of 57 Msolar of 56Ni is produced, making these the most energetic and the brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe. Integrating over a distribution of masses, we find that pair instability supernovae produce a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear charge (Si, S, Ar, etc.) but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd nuclear charge-Na, Al, P, V, Mn, etc. This is because there is no stage of stable post-helium burning to set the neutron excess. Also, essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced owing to a lack of s- and r-processes. The Fe/Si ratio is quite sensitive to whether the upper bound on the initial mass function is over 260 Msolar or somewhere between 140 and 260 Msolar. When the yields of pair instability supernovae are combined with reasonable estimates of the nucleosynthesis of Population III stars from 12 to 40 Msolar, this distinctive pattern of deficient production of odd-Z elements persists. Some possible strategies for testing our predictions are discussed.},

A cusp of stars and BHs generates a continuous GW spectrum below 40 nHz; individual BHs within 1 mpc to SgrA* stick out in the spectrum at higher GW frequencies. The GWs and gravitational near-field effects can be resolved by timing pulsars within a few pc of this region. Observations with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) may be especially sensitive to intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) in this region, if present. A 100ns-10mus timing accuracy is sufficient to detect BHs of mass 1000 Msun with pulsars at distance 0.1-1 pc in a 3 yr observation baseline. Unlike electromagnetic imaging techniques, the prospects for resolving individual objects through GW measurements improve closer to SgrA*, even if the number density of objects increases inwards steeply.

abstract = {Stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars represent extremes in gravity, density, and magnetic fields. They therefore serve as key objects in the study of multiple frontiers of physics. In addition, their origin (mainly in core-collapse supernovae) and evolution (via accretion or, for neutron stars, magnetic spindown and reconfiguration) touch upon multiple open issues in astrophysics.   In this review, we discuss current mass and spin measurements and their reliability for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, as well as the overall importance of spins and masses for compact object astrophysics. Current masses are obtained primarily through electromagnetic observations of binaries, although future microlensing observations promise to enhance our understanding substantially. The spins of neutron stars are straightforward to measure for pulsars, but the birth spins of neutron stars are more difficult to determine. In contrast, even the current spins of stellar-mass black holes are challenging to measure. As we discuss, major inroads have been made in black hole spin estimates via analysis of iron lines and continuum emission, with reasonable agreement when both types of estimate are possible for individual objects, and future X-ray polarization measurements may provide additional independent information. We conclude by exploring the exciting prospects for mass and spin measurements from future gravitational wave detections, which are expected to revolutionize our understanding of strong gravity and compact objects.},

 concentrating on its one-year orbital motion around the Sun. We compute how the amplitude as well as
 the phase of a gravitational wave are modulated due to this motion by transforming an arbitrary
 gravitational-wave signal in a reference frame that is rigidly fixed to the arms of the detector. To
 see how LISA works the detector response to a gravitational wave which is purely monochromatic in
 the barycentric frame will be discussed.
 
 A brief review of the theory of parameter estimation, based on the work of Finn and Cutler, will be
 given. Following this theory the detection of a gravitational-wave signal buried in detector noise

Among the consequences of this method which are presently discussed, it is noted that the Keplerian, circular velocity around a finite galaxy becomes independent of r at large radii, yielding asymptotically flat velocity curves. The discrepancy between the dynamically determined Oort density in the solar neighborhood and the density of observed matter, moreover, is found to disappear. It is predicted in view of these results that rotation curves calculated on the basis of the observed mass distribution and the modified dynamics should agree with the observed velocity curves.},

abstract = {We report on the first fully consistent conventional cluster simulation which includes terms up to the third-order post-Newtonian approximation. Numerical problems for treating extremely energetic binaries orbiting a single massive object are circumvented by employing the special `wheel-spoke' regularization method of Zare which has not been used in large-N simulations before. Idealized models containing N = 1 × 105 particles of mass 1Msolar with a central black hole (BH) of 300Msolar have been studied on GRAPE-type computers. An initial half-mass radius of rh $\sim$= 0.1 pc is sufficiently small to yield examples of relativistic coalescence. This is achieved by significant binary shrinkage within a density cusp environment, followed by the generation of extremely high eccentricities which are induced by Kozai cycles and/or resonant relaxation. More realistic models with white dwarfs and 10 times larger half-mass radii also show evidence of general relativity effects before disruption. An experimentation with the post-Newtonian terms suggests that reducing the time-scales for activating the different orders progressively may be justified for obtaining qualitatively correct solutions without aiming for precise predictions of the final gravitational radiation wave form. The results obtained suggest that the standard loss-cone arguments underestimate the swallowing rate in globular clusters containing a central BH.},

abstract = {The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) is a consortium of astronomers whose goal is the creation of a galactic scale gravitational wave observatory sensitive to gravitational waves in the nHz-microHz band. It is just one component of an international collaboration involving similar organizations of European and Australian astronomers who share the same goal. Gravitational waves, a prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity, are a phenomenon of dynamical space-time generated by the bulk motion of matter, and the dynamics of space-time itself. They are detectable by the small disturbance they cause in the light travel time between some light source and an observer. NANOGrav exploits radio pulsars as both the light (radio) source and the clock against which the light travel time is measured. In an array of radio pulsars gravitational waves manifest themselves as correlated disturbances in the pulse arrival times. The timing precision of today's best measured pulsars is less than 100 ns. With improved instrumentation and signal-to-noise it is widely believed that the next decade could see a pulsar timing network of 100 pulsars each with better than 100 ns timing precision. Such a pulsar timing array (PTA), observed with a regular cadence of days to weeks, would be capable of observing supermassive black hole binaries following galactic mergers, relic radiation from early universe phenomena such as cosmic strings, cosmic superstrings, or inflation, and more generally providing a vantage on the universe whose revolutionary potential has not been seen in the 400 years since Galileo first turned a telescope to the heavens.},

abstract = {General relativity predicts the existence of black holes, compact objects whose spacetimes depend on only their mass and spin (the famous "no hair" theorem). As various observations probe deeper into the strong fields of black hole candidates, it is becoming possible to test this prediction. Previous work suggested that such tests can be performed by measuring whether the multipolar structure of black hole candidates has the form that general relativity demands, and introduced a family of "bumpy black hole" spacetimes to be used for making these measurements. These spacetimes are black holes with the "wrong" multipoles, where the deviation from general relativity depends on the spacetime's "bumpiness." In this paper, we show how to compute the Geroch-Hansen moments of a bumpy black hole, demonstrating that there is a clean mapping between the deviations used in the bumpy black hole formalism and the Geroch-Hansen moments. We also extend our previous results to define bumpy black holes whose {\it current} moments, analogous to magnetic moments of electrodynamics, deviate from the canonical Kerr value.},

@article{Wyithe2011,
abstract = {We identify a physical mechanism that would have resulted in rapid, obscured growth of seed super-massive black-holes in galaxies at z>6. Specifically, we find that the density at the centre of typical high redshift galaxies was at a level where the Bondi accretion rate implies a diffusion speed of photons that was slower than the gravitational infall velocity, resulting in photons being trapped within the accretion flow and advected into the black-hole. We show that there is a range of black-hole masses (M_bh $\sim$ 10^3-10^5 solar masses) where the accretion flow traps radiation, corresponding to black-holes that were massive enough to generate a photon trapping accretion flow, but small enough that their Bondi radii did not exceed the isothermal scale height of self-gravitating gas. Under these conditions we find that the accretion reaches levels far in excess of the Eddington rate. A prediction of this scenario is that X-ray number counts of active galactic nuclei at z>6 would exhibit a cutoff at the low luminosities corresponding to black-hole masses below $\sim$10^5 solar masses. At low redshifts we find photon trapping to be unimportant because it could only occur in rare low spin halos, and would require black-hole masses in excess of expectations from the observed black-hole - halo mass relation. The super-Eddington growth of $\sim$10^5 solar mass seed black-holes at high redshift may have provided a natural acceleration towards the growth of super-massive black-holes at z$\sim$6-7, less than a billion years after the Big Bang.},

After enough time has elapsed, pulsar timing arrays enter a new regime where the signal to noise only scales as $\sqrt{T}$. In addition, in this regime the quality of the pulsar timing data and the cadence become relatively un-important. This occurs because the lowest frequencies of the pulsar timing residuals become gravitational-wave dominated. Pulsar timing arrays enter this regime more quickly than one might naively suspect. For T=10 yr observations and typical stochastic background amplitudes, pulsars with residual RMSs of less than about $1\,\mu$s are already in that regime. The best strategy to increase the detectability of the background in this regime is to increase the number of pulsars in the array. We also perform realistic simulations of the NANOGrav pulsar timing array, which through an aggressive pulsar survey campaign adds new millisecond pulsars regularly to its array, and show that a detection is possible within a decade, and could occur as early as 2016.},

We find an explicit expression for this constant using a particular coordinate system, the oblate spheroidal. Owing to the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in this system, it is easy to show that the second-order constant is, in fact, the square of the total angular momentum of the particle at infinity, corrected with terms which arise from the non-inertial character of the coordinate system.},

abstract = {Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are thought to be one of the most exciting gravitational wave sources to be detected with LISA. Due to their complicated nature and weak amplitudes the detection and parameter estimation of such sources is a challenging task. In this paper we present a statistical methodology based on Bayesian inference in which the estimation of parameters is carried out by advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms such as parallel tempering MCMC. We analysed high and medium mass EMRI systems that fall well inside the low frequency range of LISA. In the context of the Mock LISA Data Challenges, our investigation and results are also the first instance in which a fully Markovian algorithm is applied for EMRI searches. Results show that our algorithm worked well in recovering EMRI signals from different (simulated) LISA data sets having single and multiple EMRI sources and holds great promise for posterior computation under more realistic conditions. The search and estimation methods presented in this paper are general in their nature, and can be applied in any other scenario such as AdLIGO, AdVIRGO and Einstein Telescope with their respective response functions.},

@article{Capozziello2010a,
abstract = {Recently, a strong debate has been pursued about the Newtonian limit (i.e. small velocity and weak field) of fourth order gravity models. According to some authors, the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$-gravity is equivalent to the one of Brans-Dicke gravity with $\omega_{BD} = 0$, so that the PPN parameters of these models turn out to be ill defined. In this paper, we carefully discuss this point considering that fourth order gravity models are dynamically equivalent to the O'Hanlon Lagrangian. This is a special case of scalar-tensor gravity characterized only by self-interaction potential and that, in the Newtonian limit, this implies a non-standard behavior that cannot be compared with the usual PPN limit of General Relativity. The result turns out to be completely different from the one of Brans-Dicke theory and in particular suggests that it is misleading to consider the PPN parameters of this theory with $\omega_{BD} = 0$ in order to characterize the homologous quantities of $f(R)$-gravity. Finally the solutions at Newtonian level, obtained in the Jordan frame for a $f(R)$-gravity, reinterpreted as a scalar-tensor theory, are linked to those in the Einstein frame.},

abstract = {One of the main astrophysical processes leading to strong emission of gravitational waves to be detected by the future space-borne interferometer LISA is the capture of a compact star by a black hole with a mass of a few million solar masses in the center of a galaxy. In previous studies, main sequence stars were thought not to contribute because they suffer from early tidal disruption. Here we show that, according to our simulations of the stellar dynamics of the Sgr A* cluster, there must be one to a few low-mass main sequence stars sufficiently bound to the central Galactic black hole to be conspicuous sources in LISA observations. The probability that a white dwarf may be detectable is lower than 0.5 and, in spite of mass segregation, detection of a captured neutron star or stellar black hole in the center of the Milky Way is highly unlikely.},

abstract = {The late stage of an inspiraling neutron star binary gives rise to strong gravitational wave emission due to its highly dynamic, strong gravity. Moreover, interactions between the stellar magnetospheres can produce considerable electromagnetic radiation. We study this scenario using fully general relativistic, resistive magneto-hydrodynamics simulations. We show that these interactions extract kinetic energy from the system, dissipate heat, and power radiative Poynting flux, as well as develop current sheets. Our results indicate that this power can: (i) outshine pulsars in binaries, (ii) display a distinctive angular- and time-dependent pattern, and (iii) radiate within large opening angles. These properties suggest that some binary neutron star mergers are ideal candidates for multimessenger astronomy.},

@article{Kauffmann2000,
abstract = {We incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holes into semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter dominated Universe. We assume that supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. If two galaxies of comparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few percent of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a timescale of a few times 10^7 years. With these simple assumptions, our model not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar population with redshift and the relation between the luminosities of nearby quasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number density of quasars from z=2 to z=0 is due to the combination of three effects: i) a decrease in the merging rate, ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas available to fuel black holes, and iii) an increase in the timescale for gas accretion. In a LCDM cosmology the predicted decline in the total content of cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of damped Lyman-alpha systems. Our results strongly suggest that the evolution of supermassive black holes, quasars and starbursts is inextricably linked to the hierarchical build-up of galaxies.},

abstract = {In the context of $f(R)$ theories of gravity, we address the problem of finding static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions. Several aspects of constant curvature solutions with and without electric charge are discussed. We also study the general case (without imposing constant curvature). Following a perturbative approach around the Einstein-Hilbert action, it is found that only solutions of the Schwarzschild-(anti) de Sitter type are present up to second order in perturbations. Explicit expressions for the effective cosmological constant are obtained in terms of the $f(R)$ function. Finally, we have considered the thermodynamics of black holes in anti-de Sitter space-time and found that this kind of solutions can only exist provided the theory satisfies $R_0+f(R_0)<0$. Interestingly, this expression is related to the condition which guarantees the positivity of the effective Newton's constant in this type of theories. In addition, it also ensures that the thermodynamical properties in $f(R)$ gravities are qualitatively similar to those of standard General Relativity.},

abstract = {We provide a detailed analysis of 12 XMM observations of the nearest persistent extragalactic ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX), M 33 X-8. No significant spectral evolution has been detected for the period of the observations, and therefore we combine the individual observations to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for a spectral fitting. The combined spectra are best fitted by a self-consistent p-free disk plus power-law component model with p = 0.571+0.032-0.030, kTin (inner disk temperature) = 1.38+0.09-0.08 keV, and the flux ratio of the p-free disk component to the power-law component being 0.63 : 0.37 in the 0.3-10 keV band. The fitting indicates that the black hole in M 33 X-8 is of ˜10odot, and accretes at a super-Eddington rate (˜1.5LEdd); also, the phase of the accretion disk is close to that of a slim disk (p = 0.5). We report, for the first time, that an extra power-law component is required in addition to the p-free disk model for ULXs. In super-Eddington cases, the power-law component may possibly result from an optically thin inner region of the disk or a Comptonized corona, similar to that of a standard thin disk.},

abstract = {The potential realization of a gravitational wave (GW) astronomy in next years is a great challenge for the scientific community. By giving a significant amount of new information, GWs will be a cornerstone for a better understanding of the universe and of the gravitational physics. In this paper the author shows that the GW astronomy will permit to solve a captivating issue of gravitation as it will be the definitive test for the famous "Einstein frame versus Jordan frame" controversy. In fact, we show that the motion of the test masses, i.e. the beam splitter and the mirror in the case of an interferometer, which is due to the scalar component of a GW, is different in the two frames. Thus, if a consistent GW astronomy will be realized, an eventual detection of signals of scalar GWs will permit to discriminate among the two frames. In this way, a direct evidence from observations will solve in an ultimate way the famous and long history of the "Einstein frame versus Jordan frame" controversy.},

abstract = {We present new VLA observations toward NGC 253 of the recombination line H53$\alpha$ (43 GHz) at an angular resolution of 1.5"×1.0". The free-free emission at 43 GHz is estimated to be $\sim$140 mJy, implying a star formation rate of 2 Msolar yr-1 in the nuclear region of this starburst galaxy. A reanalysis is made for previously reported H92$\alpha$ observations carried out with angular resolution of 1.5"×1.0" and 0.36"×0.21". Based on the line and continuum emission models used for the 1.5"×1.0" angular resolution observations, the RRLs H53$\alpha$ and H92$\alpha$ are tracers of the high-density ($\sim$105 cm-3) and low-density ($\sim$103 cm-3) thermally ionized gas components in NGC 253, respectively. The velocity fields observed in the H53$\alpha$ and H92$\alpha$ lines (1.5"×1.0") are consistent. The velocity gradient in the central $\sim$18 pc of the NE component, as observed in both the H53$\alpha$ and H92$\alpha$ lines, is in the opposite direction to the velocity gradient determined from the CO observations. The enclosed virial mass, as deduced from the H53$\alpha$ velocity gradient over the NE component, is $\sim$5×106 Msolar in the central $\sim$18 pc region. The H92$\alpha$ line observations at high angular resolution (0.36"×0.21") reveal a larger velocity gradient, along a P.A.$\sim$-45deg on the NE component, of $\sim$110 km s-1 arcsec-1. The dynamical mass estimated using the high angular resolution H92$\alpha$ data ($\sim$7×106 Msolar) supports the existence of an accreted massive object in the nuclear region of NGC 253.},

LIGO, a joint Caltech–MIT project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning.

The gravitational effect of the wake on the object is investigated in this paper. The phase density of the background in the spherical potential of the object is derived analytically. The corresponding background response density and the force of dynamical friction over the entire extent of the object are found by numerical integration. The force field is separated into effective decelerating and deforming components. The first component is shown to be in agreement with previous results; the latter is of the same order of magnitude and might cause stripping of the object's outer parts. Tidal stripping caused by the variation of the potential of a non-homogeneous gravitationally bound background system is shown to be dominant over dynamical friction stripping.},

abstract = {Pulsar timing is a promising technique for detecting low frequency sources of gravitational waves. Historically the focus has been on the detection of diffuse stochastic backgrounds, such as those formed from the superposition of weak signals from a population of binary black holes. More recently, attention has turned to members of the binary population that are nearer and brighter, which stand out from the crowd and can be individually resolved. Here we show that the timing data from an array of pulsars can be used to recover the physical parameters describing an individual black hole binary to good accuracy, even for moderately strong signals. A novel aspect of our analysis is that we include the distance to each pulsar as a search parameter, which allows us to utilize the full gravitational wave signal. This doubles the signal power, improves the sky location determination by an order of magnitude, and allows us to extract the mass and the distance to the black hole binary.},

Indirect arguments suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A statistical survey finds BHs in $\sim 20\%$ of nearby E--Sbc galaxies, consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component. Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation. Flashes caused by the accretion of individual stars may provide a test of the BH picture.},

abstract = {Gravitational wave astronomy has tremendous potential for studying extreme astrophysical phenomena and exploring fundamental physics. The waves produced by binary black hole mergers will provide a pristine environment in which to study strong field, dynamical gravity. Extracting detailed information about these systems requires accurate theoretical models of the gravitational wave signals. If gravity is not described by General Relativity, analyses that are based on waveforms derived from Einstein's field equations could result in parameter biases and a loss of detection efficiency. A new class of "parameterized post-Einsteinian" (ppE) waveforms has been proposed to cover this eventuality. Here we apply the ppE approach to simulated data from a network of advanced ground based interferometers (aLIGO/aVirgo) and from a future spaced based interferometer (LISA). Bayesian inference and model selection are used to investigate parameter biases, and to determine the level at which departures from general relativity can be detected. We find that in some cases the parameter biases from assuming the wrong theory can be severe. We also find that gravitational wave observations will beat the existing bounds on deviations from general relativity derived from the orbital decay of binary pulsars by a large margin across a wide swath of parameter space.},

abstract = {If the stellar population of the bulge contains black holes formed in the final core collapse of ordinary stars with M>$\sim$30 Msolar, then about 25,000 stellar mass black holes should have migrated by dynamical friction into the central parsec of the Milky Way, forming a black hole cluster around the central supermassive black hole. These black holes can be captured by the central black hole when they randomly reach a highly eccentric orbit due to relaxation, either by direct capture (when their Newtonian peribothron is less than 4 Schwarzschild radii) or after losing orbital energy through gravitational waves. The overall depletion timescale is $\sim$30 Gyr, so most of the 25,000 black holes remain in the central cluster today. The presence of this black hole cluster would have several observable consequences. First, the low-mass, old stellar population should have been expelled from the region occupied by the black hole cluster as a result of relaxation, implying a core in the profile of solar-mass red giants with a radius of $\sim$2 pc (i.e., 1'). The observed central density cusp (which has a core radius of only a few arcseconds) should be composed primarily of young (<$\sim$1 Gyr) stars. Second, flares from stars being captured by supermassive black holes in other galaxies should be rarer than usually expected because the older stars will have been expelled from the central regions by the black hole clusters of those galaxies. Third, the young (<$\sim$2 Gyr) stars found at distances $\sim$3-10 pc from the Galactic center should be preferentially on highly eccentric orbits. Fourth, if future high-resolution K-band images reveal sources microlensed by the Milky Way's central black hole, then the cluster black holes could give rise to secondary (``planet-like'') perturbations on the main event.},

abstract = {We develop here a new procedure within Einstein's theory of gravity to generate equilibrium configurations that result as the final state of gravitational collapse from regular initial conditions. As a simplification, we assume that the collapsing fluid is supported only by tangential pressure. We show that the equilibrium geometries generated by this method form a subset of static solutions to the Einstein equations, and that they can either be regular or develop a naked singularity at the center. When a singularity is present, there are key differences in the properties of stable circular orbits relative to those around a Schwarzschild black hole with the same mass. Therefore, if an accretion disk is present around such a naked singularity it could be observationally distinguished from a disk around a black hole.},

abstract = {Inclusion of the four-derivative terms ∫R$\mu$$\nu$R$\mu$$\nu$(−g)1/2 and ∫R2(−g)1/2 into the gravitational action gives a class of effectively multimass models of gravity. In addition to the usual massless excitations of the field, there are now, for general amounts of the two new terms, massive spin-two and massive scalar excitations, with a total of eight degrees of freedom. The massive spin-two part of the field has negative energy. Specific ratios of the two new terms give models with either the massive tensor or the massive scalar missing, with correspondingly fewer degrees of freedom. The static, linearized solutions of the field equations are combinations of Newtonian and Yukawa potentials. Owing to the Yukawa form of the corrections, observational evidence sets only very weak restrictions on the new masses. The acceptable static metric solutions in the full nonlinear theory are regular at the origin. The dynamical content of the linearized field is analyzed by reducing the fourth-order field equations to separated second-order equations, related by coupling to external sources in a fixed ratio. This analysis is carried out into the various helicity components using the transverse-traceless decomposition of the metric.},

By comparing the predictions of these theories with laboratory and solar system experiments, we find a set of inequalities that any lagrangian f(R) must satisfy. The constraints imposed by those inequalities allow us to find explicit bounds to the possible nonlinear terms of the lagrangian. We conclude that in both formalisms the lagrangian f(R) must be almost linear in R and that corrections that grow at low curvatures are incompatible with observations. This result shows that modifications of gravity at very low cosmic densities cannot be responsible for the observed cosmic speed-up.},

We estimate the rate of capture of compact objects by massive central black holes, assuming that most spiral galaxies have a central black hole of modest mass ($\sim$10^6Msolar), and a cuspy spheroid. It is likely that the total capture rate is dominated by nucleated spirals. We estimate the flux of gravitational wave radiation from such coalescences, and the estimated detectable source count for proposed space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. About one event per year should be detectable within 1Gpc, given very conservative estimates of the black hole masses and central galactic densities. We expect 10^2-10^3 detectable sources at lower frequencies (10^-4Hz) `en route' to capture. If stellar mass black holes are ubiquitous, the signal may be dominated by stellar mass black holes coalescing with massive black holes. The rate of white dwarf-white dwarf mergers in the cores of nucleated spirals is estimated at $\sim$10^-6 per year per galaxy.},

@article{Yu2002,
abstract = {We study the observational constraints on the growth of massive black holes (BHs) in galactic nuclei. We use the velocity dispersions of early-type galaxies obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the relation between BH mass and velocity dispersion to estimate the local BH mass density to be $\rho$•(z= 0) $\sim$= (2.5 +/- 0.4) × 105h0.652Msolar Mpc-3. We also use the quasi-stellar object (QSO) luminosity function from the 2dF Redshift Survey to estimate the BH mass density accreted during optically bright QSO phases. The local BH mass density is consistent with the density accreted during optically bright QSO phases if QSOs have a mass-to-energy conversion efficiency ɛ$\sim$= 0.1. By studying the continuity equation for the BH mass distribution, including the effect of BH mergers, we find relations between the local BH mass function and the QSO luminosity function. If the BH mass is assumed to be conserved during BH mergers, comparison of the predicted relations with the observations suggests that luminous QSOs (Lbol>$\sim$ 1046 erg s-1) have a high efficiency (e.g. ɛ$\sim$ 0.2, which is possible for thin-disc accretion on to a Kerr BH) and the growth of high-mass BHs (>$\sim$108Msolar) comes mainly from accretion during optically bright QSO phases, or that luminous QSOs have a super-Eddington luminosity. If luminous QSOs are not accreting with super-Eddington luminosities and the growth of low-mass BHs also occurs mainly during optically bright QSO phases, less luminous QSOs must accrete with a low efficiency, <0.1 alternatively, they may accrete with high efficiency, but a significant fraction should be obscured. We estimate that the mean lifetime of luminous QSOs (Lbol>$\sim$ 1046 erg s-1) is (3-13) × 107 yr, which is comparable to the Salpeter time. We also investigate the case in which total BH mass decreases during BH mergers due to gravitational radiation; in the extreme case in which total BH entropy is conserved, the observations again suggest that BHs in most luminous QSOs are Kerr BHs accreting with an efficiency >$\sim$0.1.},

abstract = {The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is designed to detect gravitational wave signals from astrophysical sources, including those from coalescing binary systems of compact objects such as black holes. Colliding galaxies have central black holes that sink to the center of the merged galaxy and begin to orbit one another and emit gravitational waves. Some galaxy evolution models predict that the binary black hole system will enter the LISA band with significant orbital eccentricity, while other models suggest that the orbits will already have circularized. Using a full seventeen parameter waveform model that includes the effects of orbital eccentricity, spin precession and higher harmonics, we investigate how well the source parameters can be inferred from simulated LISA data. Defining the reference eccentricity as the value one year before merger, we find that for typical LISA sources, it will be possible to measure the eccentricity to an accuracy of parts in a thousand. The accuracy with which the eccentricity can be measured depends only very weakly on the eccentricity, making it possible to distinguish circular orbits from those with very small eccentricities. LISA measurements of the orbital eccentricity can provide strong constraints on theories of galaxy mergers in the early universe.},

abstract = {Galaxy mergers play a key role in the evolution of galaxies and the growth of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A search for (active) SMBH binaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of the merger remnants is currently ongoing. Perhaps the greatest challenge is to identify the inactive SMBHBs, which might be the most abundant, but are also the most difficult to identify. Liu et al. predicted characteristic drops in the light curves of tidal disruption events (TDEs), caused by the presence of a secondary SMBH. Here, we apply that model to the light curve of the optically inactive galaxy SDSS J120136.02+300305.5, which was identified as a candidate TDE with XMM-Newton. We show that the deep dips in its evolving X-ray light curve can be well explained by the presence of a SMBHB at its core. A SMBHB model with a mass of the primary of M_BH = 10^7 M_sun, a mass ratio q=0.08, and a semimajor axis a_b = 0.6 mpc is in good agreement with the observations. Given that primary mass, introducing an orbital eccentricity is needed, with e_b = 0.3. Alternatively, a lower mass primary of M_BH = 10^6 M_sun in a circular orbit fits the light curve well. Tight binaries like this one, which have already overcome the "final parsec problem," are prime sources of gravitational wave radiation once the two SMBHs coalesce. Future transient surveys, which will detect TDEs in large numbers, will place tight constraints on the SMBHB fraction in otherwise non-active galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a possible observing scenario for the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational wave detectors over the next decade, with the intention of providing information to the astronomy community to facilitate planning for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves. We determine the expected sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals, and study the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source. For concreteness, we focus primarily on gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary neutron star (BNS) systems, as the source considered likely to be the most common for detection and also promising for multimessenger astronomy. We find that confident detections will likely require at least 2 detectors operating with BNS sensitive ranges of at least 100 Mpc, while ranges approaching 200 Mpc should give at least $\sim$1 BNS detection per year even under pessimistic predictions of signal rates. The ability to localize the source of the detected signals depends on the geographical distribution of the detectors and their relative sensitivity, and can be as large as thousands of square degrees with only 2 sensitive detectors operating. Determining the sky position of a significant fraction of detected signals to areas of 5 sq deg to 20 sq deg will require at least 3 detectors of sensitivity within a factor of $\sim$2 of each other and with a broad frequency bandwidth. Should one of the LIGO detectors be relocated in India as expected, many gravitational-wave signals will be localized to a few square degrees by gravitational-wave observations alone.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves and X-ray flares are expected from tidal disruption of stars by a massive black hole. Using a relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, we investigate the fate of main sequence and Helium stars in plunge orbits passing near Schwarzschild or a Kerr black holes of 10^5-6 Msun. We show that quadrupole gravitational waves emitted during the tidal disruption process are described reasonable well by a point particle approximation even in the strong encounter case. An additional hydrodynamic calculation based on the Godunov method indicates that shocks develop for sufficiently high tidal compressions. The shock-heating results in an X-ray flare, which for solar-type stars disrupted by 10^6Msun black holes is in the keV range, associated with the gravitational wave signal. The hardness and duration of the X-ray flare may serve as a diagnostic of the mass of the central black hole.},

abstract = {We present the spectral results from a 130 ks observation, obtained from the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission-Newton (XMM-Newton) observatory, of the type I Seyfert galaxy Fairall 9. An X-ray hardness-ratio analysis of the light-curves, reveals a `softer-when-brighter' behaviour which is typical for radio-quiet type I Seyfert galaxies. Moreover, we analyse the high spectral-resolution data of the reflection grating spectrometer and we did not find any significant evidence supporting the presence of warm-absorber in the low X-ray energy part of the source's spectrum. This means that the central nucleus of Fairall 9 is `clean' and thus its X-ray spectral properties probe directly the physical conditions of the central engine. The overall X-ray spectrum in the 0.5-10 keV energy-range, derived from the EPIC data, can be modelled by a relativistically blurred disc-reflection model. This spectral model yields for Fairall 9 an intermediate black-hole best-fit spin parameter of $\alpha=0.39^{+0.48}_{-0.30}$.},

abstract = {We study the late evolution of solar metallicity stars in the transition region between white dwarf formation and core collapse. This includes the super-asymptotic giant branch (super-AGB, SAGB) stars, which ignite carbon burning and form an oxygen-neon (ONe) core. SAGB star cores may grow to the Chandrasekhar mass because of continued H- and He-shell burning, ending as core-collapse supernovae. From stellar evolution models we find that the initial mass range for SAGB evolution is 7.5-9.25 Msolar. We perform calculations with three different stellar evolution codes to judge the robustness of our results. The mass range significantly depends on the treatment of semiconvective mixing and convective overshooting. To consider the effect of a large number of thermal pulses, as expected in SAGB stars, we construct synthetic SAGB models that are calibrated through stellar evolution simulations. The synthetic model enables us to compute the evolution of the main properties of SAGB stars from the onset of thermal pulses until the core reaches the Chandrasekhar mass or is uncovered by the stellar wind. Thereby, we differentiate the stellar initial mass ranges that produce ONe WDs from that leading to electron-capture SNe. The latter is found to be 9.0-9.25 Msolar for our fiducial model, implying that electron-capture SNe would constitute about 4% of all SNe in the local universe. The error in this determination due to uncertainties in the third dredge-up efficiency and AGB mass-loss rate could lead to about a doubling of the number of electron-capture SNe, which provides a firm upper limit to their contribution to all supernovae of $\sim$20%.},

@article{Poisson2004,
abstract = {This review is concerned with the motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime. In each of the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing radiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In the near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force that prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background spacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because of its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But it is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no force on the particle -- its only effect is to contribute to the particle's inertia. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully responsible for the self-force. Because this field satisfies a homogeneous wave equation, it can be thought of as a free (radiative) field that interacts with the particle; it is this interaction that gives rise to the self-force. The mathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime are developed here from scratch. The review begins with a discussion of the basic theory of bitensors (part I). It then applies the theory to the construction of convenient coordinate systems to chart a neighbourhood of the particle's word line (part II). It continues with a thorough discussion of Green's functions in curved spacetime (part III). The review concludes with a detailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion (part IV).},

@article{Hopman2010,
abstract = {Two-body energy exchange between stars orbiting massive black holes (MBHs) leads to the formation of a power-law density distribution n(r)$\sim$r^(-a) that diverges towards the MBH. For a single mass population, a=7/4 and the flow of stars is much less than N(<r)/t_r (enclosed number of stars per relaxation time). This "zero-flow" solution is maintained for a multi-mass system for moderate mass ratios or systems where there are many heavy stars, and slopes of 3/2<a<2 are reached, with steeper slopes for the more massive stars. If the heavy stars are rare and massive however, the zero-flow limit breaks down and much steeper distributions are obtained.   We discuss the physics driving mass-segregation with the use of Fokker-Planck calculations, and show that steady state is reached in 0.2-0.3 t_r. Since the relaxation time in the Galactic centre (GC) is t_r $\sim$2-3 * 10^(10) yr, a cusp should form in less than a Hubble time. The absence of a visible cusp of old stars in the GC poses a challenge to these models, suggesting that processes other than two-body relaxation have played a role. We discuss astrophysical processes within the GC that depend crucially on the details of the stellar cusp.},

abstract = {We calculate analytical gravitational waveforms in the time- and frequency-domain for precessing quasi-circular binaries with spins of arbitrary magnitude, but nearly aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We first derive an analytical solution to the precession equations by expanding in the misalignment angle and using multiple scale analysis to separate timescales. We then use uniform asymptotic expansions to analytically Fourier transform the time-domain waveform, thus extending the stationary-phase approximation, which fails when precession is present. The resulting frequency-domain waveform family has a high overlap with numerical waveforms obtained by direct integration of the post-Newtonian equations of motion and discrete Fourier transformations. Such a waveform family lays the foundations for the accurate inclusion of spin precession effects in analytical gravitational waveforms, and thus, it can aid in the detection and parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals from the inspiral phase of precessing binary systems.},

abstract = {To determine whether particular sources of gravitational radiation will be detectable by a specific gravitational wave detector, it is necessary to know the sensitivity limits of the instrument. These instrumental sensitivities are often depicted (after averaging over source position and polarization) by graphing the minimal values of the gravitational wave amplitude detectable by the instrument versus the frequency of the gravitational wave. This paper describes in detail how to compute such a sensitivity curve given a set of specifications for a spaceborne laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory. Minor errors in the prior literature are corrected, and the first (mostly) analytic calculation of the gravitational wave transfer function is presented. Example sensitivity curve calculations are presented for the proposed LISA interferometer. We find that previous treatments of LISA have underestimated its sensitivity by a factor of $\sqrt{3}$.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of the SKA enables a number of tests of theories of gravity. A Galactic Census of pulsars will discover most of the active pulsars in the Galaxy beamed toward us. In this census will almost certainly be pulsar–black hole binaries as well as pulsars orbiting the super-massive black hole in the Galactic centre. These systems are unique in their capability to probe the ultra-strong field limit of relativistic gravity. These measurements can be used to test the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture and the No-Hair theorem. The large number of millisecond pulsars discovered with the SKA will also provide a dense array of precision clocks on the sky. These clocks will act as the multiple arms of a huge gravitational wave detector, which can be used to detect and measure the stochastic cosmological gravitational wave background that is expected from a number of sources.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that an intermediate-massive black hole (IMBH) with mass 10^{3-5} M_\odot could fall into the galactic center (GC) and form an massive black hole binary (MBHB) with the central supermassive black hole, but current observational are not sensitive to constrain all mass and distance ranges. Motivated by the recent discovery that MBHBs could enhance the rate of tidal-disruption events (TDEs) of stellar objects, we investigate the prospect of using stellar-disruption rate to probe IMBHs in the GC. We incorporated the perturbation by an IMBH into the loss-cone theory and calculated the stellar-disruption rates in the GC. We found that an IMBH heavier than 2000 M_\odot could distinguishably enhance the stellar-disruption rate. By comparing observations of Sgr A* with the fall-back model for stellar debris, we suggested that the TDE rate in our Galaxy should not significantly exceed 0.002 per year, therefore a fraction of the parameter space for the IMBH, concentrating at the high-mass end, can already be excluded. To derive constraint in the remaining parameter space, it is crucial to observationally confirm or reject the stellar-disruption rate between 10^{-4} and 0.01 yr^{-1}, and we discussed possible strategies to make such measurements.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that, when the pressure within stellar matter becomes high enough, a new phase consisting of neutrons will be formed. In this paper we study the gravitational equilibrium of masses of neutrons, using the equation of state for a cold Fermi gas, and general relativity. For masses under 1/3⊙ only one equilibrium solution exists, which is approximately described by the nonrelativistic Fermi equation of state and Newtonian gravitational theory. For masses 1/3⊙<m<3/4⊙ two solutions exist, one stable and quasi-Newtonian, one more condensed, and unstable. For masses greater than 3/4⊙ there are no static equilibrium solutions. These results are qualitatively confirmed by comparison with suitably chosen special cases of the analytic solutions recently discovered by Tolman. A discussion of the probable effect of deviations from the Fermi equation of state suggests that actual stellar matter after the exhaustion of thermonuclear sources of energy will, if massive enough, contract indefinitely, although more and more slowly, never reaching true equilibrium.},

We obtain the gravitational field equations in the metric formalism, as well as the equations of motion for test particles, which follow from the covariant divergence of the energy-momentum tensor. The equations of motion for test particles can also be derived from a variational principle in the particular case in which the Lagrangian density of the matter is an arbitrary function of the energy-density of the matter only. Generally, the motion is non-geodesic, and takes place in the presence of an extra force orthogonal to the four-velocity. The Newtonian limit of the model is also considered, and a procedure for obtaining the energy-momentum tensor of the matter is presented. The gravitational field equations and the equations of motion for a particular model in which the action of the gravitational field has an exponential dependence on the standard general relativistic Hilbert--Einstein Lagrange density are also derived.},

abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

abstract = {Short, hard, {\gamma}-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from the coalescence of two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole (BH). If this scenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of strong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW searches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have the advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known time and sky location and preferentially higher GW amplitude because of face-on orientation. Based on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in candidate compact binary coalescence (CBC) events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic estimates, and our Monte-Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive volume for GRB-triggered searches that is $\sim$2 times greater than for an all-sky, all-time search. For NS-NS systems, a jet angle 20{\deg}, a {\gamma}-ray satellite field of view of 10% of the sky, and priors with generally precessing spin, this doubles the number of NS-NS--short GRB and NS-BH--short GRB associations, to $\sim$3-4% of all detections of NS-NSs and of NS-BHs. We also investigate the power of tests for statistical excesses in lists of sub-threshold events, and show that these are unlikely to reveal a sub-threshold population until finding GW associations to short GRBs is already routine. Finally, in Appendix A we provide useful formulae for calculating the prior distribution of GW amplitudes from a CBC, for a given GW detector network and given sky location.},

abstract = {Generic Kerr orbits exhibit intricate three-dimensional motion. We offer a classification scheme for these intricate orbits in terms of periodic orbits. The crucial insight is that for a given effective angular momentum $L$ and angle of inclination $\iota$, there exists a discrete set of orbits that are geometrically $n$-leaf clovers in a precessing {\it orbital plane}. When viewed in the full three dimensions, these orbits are periodic in $r-\theta$. Each $n$-leaf clover is associated with a rational number, $1+q_{r\theta}=\omega_\theta/\omega_r$, that measures the degree of perihelion precession in the precessing orbital plane. The rational number $q_{r\theta}$ varies monotonically with the orbital energy and with the orbital eccentricity. Since any bound orbit can be approximated as near one of these periodic $n$-leaf clovers, this special set offers a skeleton that illuminates the structure of all bound Kerr orbits, in or out of the equatorial plane.},

abstract = {In this letter we examine if the properties of central black holes in galactic nuclei correlate with their host dark matter halo. We analyze the entire sample of galaxies where black hole mass, velocity dispersion, sigma, and asymptotic circular velocity, Vc, have all been measured. We fit MBH-sigma and MBH-Vc to a power law, and find that in both relationships the scatter and slope are very similar. This model independent analysis suggests that the MBH-Vc correlation is as strong (or as weak) as the correlation between MBH-sigma given current samples. The correlation worsens for both sigma and Vc below $\sim$100 km/s. This is not unexpected given our current understanding of galaxy and black hole assembly. In fact, there are several compelling reasons that account for this: (i) SMBH formation is likely less efficient in low-mass galaxies with large angular momentum content; (ii) SMBH growth is less efficient in low-mass disk galaxies that have not experienced major mergers; (iii) dynamical effects, such as gravitational recoil, increase scatter preferentially at the low-mass end. Therefore, the absence of central SMBHs in bulge-less, low mass galaxies, or deviations from the correlations defined by high-mass black holes in large galaxies today does not necessarily indicate a lack of correlation between the dark matter halo and the central object; in fact, this is a prediction of models that do predicate such a correlation at high redshifts.},

abstract = {We consider a general class of quantum gravity-inspired, modified gravity theories, where the Einstein-Hilbert action is extended through the addition of all terms quadratic in the curvature tensor coupled to scalar fields with standard kinetic energy. This class of theories includes Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons modified gravity as special cases. We analytically derive and solve the coupled field equations in the post-Newtonian approximation, assuming a comparable-mass, spinning black hole binary source in a quasi-circular, weak-field/slow-motion orbit. We find that a naive subtraction of divergent piece associated with the point-particle approximation is ill-suited to represent compact objects in these theories. Instead, we model them by appropriate effective sources built so that known strong-field solutions are reproduced in the far-field limit. In doing so, we prove that black holes in Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons theory can have hair, while neutron stars have no scalar monopole charge, in diametrical opposition to results in scalar-tensor theories. We then employ techniques similar to the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations to obtain analytic expressions for the scalar field, metric perturbation, and the associated gravitational wave luminosity measured at infinity. We find that scalar field emission mainly dominates the energy flux budget, sourcing electric-type (even-parity) dipole scalar radiation and magnetic-type (odd-parity) quadrupole scalar radiation, correcting the General Relativistic prediction at relative -1PN and 2PN orders. Such modifications lead to corrections in the emitted gravitational waves that can be mapped to the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework. Such modifications could be strongly constrained with gravitational wave observations.},

In this work we will focus on the detection and characterization of single GW sources from supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). We introduce a fully Bayesian data analysis pipeline that is meant to carry out a search, characterization, and evaluation phase. This will allow us to rapidly locate the global maxima in parameter space, map out the posterior, and finally weigh the evidence of a GW detection through a Bayes Factor.

abstract = {I review the current status of X-ray reflection (a.k.a. broad iron line) based black hole spin measurements. This is a powerful technique that allows us to measure robust black hole spins across the mass range, from the stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries to the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. After describing the basic assumptions of this approach, I lay out the detailed methodology focusing on "best practices" that have been found necessary to obtain robust results. Reflecting my own biases, this review is slanted towards a discussion of supermassive black hole (SMBH) spin in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Pulling together all of the available XMM-Newton and Suzaku results from the literature that satisfy objective quality control criteria, it is clear that a large fraction of SMBHs are rapidly-spinning, although there are tentative hints of a more slowly spinning population at high (M>5*10^7Msun) and low (M<2*10^6Msun) mass. I also engage in a brief review of the spins of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries. In general, reflection-based and continuum-fitting based spin measures are in agreement, although there remain two objects (GROJ1655-40 and 4U1543-475) for which that is not true. I end this review by discussing the exciting frontier of relativistic reverberation, particularly the discovery of broad iron line reverberation in XMM-Newton data for the Seyfert galaxies NGC4151, NGC7314 and MCG-5-23-16. As well as confirming the basic paradigm of relativistic disk reflection, this detection of reverberation demonstrates that future large-area X-ray observatories such as LOFT will make tremendous progress in studies of strong gravity using relativistic reverberation in AGN.},

The QPOs result from nonaxisymmetric $m=1$ structure in the accretion flow excited by MHD turbulence. Near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray power spectra show significant peaks at frequencies comparable to the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) $f_o$. The excess power is associated with inward propagating magnetic filaments inside the ISCO. The amplitudes of the QPOs are sensitive to the electron distribution function. We argue that transient QPOs appear at a range of frequencies in the neighborhood of $f_o$ and that the power spectra, averaged over long times, likely show a broad bump near $f_o$ rather than distinct, narrow QPO features.},

abstract = {General Relativity assumes that spacetime is fully described by the metric alone. An alternative is the so called Palatini formalism where the metric and the connections are taken as independent quantities. The metric-affine theory of gravity has attracted considerable attention recently, since it was shown that within this framework some cosmological models, based on some generalized gravitational actions, can account for the current accelerated expansion of the universe. However we think that metric-affine gravity deserves much more attention than that related to cosmological applications and so we consider here metric-affine gravity theories in which the gravitational action is a general function of the scalar curvature while the matter action is allowed to depend also on the connection which is not {\em a priori} symmetric. This general treatment will allow us to address several open issues such as: the relation between metric-affine $f(R)$ gravity and General Relativity (in vacuum as well as in the presence of matter), the implications of the dependence (or independence) of the matter action on the connections, the origin and role of torsion and the viability of the minimal-coupling principle.},

abstract = {Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are dense stellar clusters observed in galactic nuclei, that occasionally host a central black hole. They may form out of the inspiral of multiple star clusters. Here we test the possibility that the constituent clusters host intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). Using an N-body code we examine the dynamics of the IMBHs and their effects on the NSC formation and evolution. We find that IMBHs inspiral to the core of the newly formed NSC and segregate there. Although the IMBH scatter each other and the stars, none is ejected from the NSC. The IMBHs are excited to high eccentricities and their radial density profile develops a steep power-law cusp. The stars also develop a power-law cusp (instead of the central core that forms in their absence), but with a shallower slope. The relaxation rate of the NSC accelerates due to the presence of IMBHs as massive-perturbers. This in turn fills the loss-cone and boosts the tidal disruption rate of stars both by the MBH and the IMBHs to a value excluded by observations. The observed lower rate provides a cumulative constraint on the existence of IMBHs in NSCs.},

This is important for GW detection, e.g., by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ( LISA ). Signal identification requires knowledge of the waveforms, which depend on the orbital parameters. We use analytical and Monte Carlo methods to analyze the interplay between GW dissipation and scattering in the presence of a mass sink during the transition from the initial scattering-dominated phase to the final dissipation-dominated phase of the inspiral. Our main results are as follows. (1) Stars typically enter the GW-emitting phase with high eccentricities. (2) The GW event rate per galaxy is a few × 10 -9 yr -1 for typical central stellar cusps, almost independently of the relaxation time or the MBH mass. (3) For intermediate-mass black holes of $\sim$10 3 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} such as may exist in dense stellar clusters, the orbits are very eccentric and the inspiral is rapid, so the sources are very short-lived.},

abstract = {The planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect the inspiral and merger of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at z≲5 with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of hundreds to thousands. Because of these high SNRs, and because these SNRs accrete over periods of weeks to months, it should be possible to extract the physical parameters of these systems with high accuracy; for instance, for a ˜106M⊙ MBHBs at z=1 it should be possible to determine the two masses to ˜0.1% and the sky location to ˜1°. However, those are just the errors due to noise: there will be additional “theoretical” errors due to inaccuracies in our best model waveforms, which are still only approximate. The goal of this paper is to estimate the typical magnitude of these theoretical errors. We develop mathematical tools for this purpose, and apply them to a somewhat simplified version of the MBHB problem, in which we consider just the inspiral part of the waveform and neglect spin-induced precession, eccentricity, and PN amplitude corrections. For this simplified version, we estimate that theoretical uncertainties in sky position will typically be ˜1°, i.e., comparable to the statistical uncertainty. For the mass and spin parameters, our results suggest that while theoretical errors will be rather small absolutely, they could still dominate over statistical errors (by roughly an order of magnitude) for the strongest sources. The tools developed here should be useful for estimating the magnitude of theoretical errors in many other problems in gravitational-wave astronomy.},

It is a very challenging task to detect those sources with the accurate estimation parameters of binaries primarily due to a large number of the secondary maxima on the likelihood surface. Search algorithms based on the matched filtering require computation of the gravitational waveform hundreds of thousands of times, which is currently not feasible with the most accurate (faithful) models of EMRIs. Here we propose to use a phenomenological template family which covers a large range of EMRIs parameter space. We use these phenomenological templates to detect the signal in the simulated data and then, assuming a particular EMRI model, estimate the physical parameters of the binary. We have separated the detection problem, which is done in a model-independent way, from the parameter estimation. For the latter one, we need to adopt the model for inspiral in order to map phenomenological parameters onto the physical parameter characterizing EMRIs.},

abstract = {Bayesian parameter estimation on gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) typically requires millions of template waveform computations at different values of the parameters describing the binary. Sampling techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling evaluate likelihoods, and hence compute template waveforms, serially; thus, the total computational time of the analysis scales linearly with that of template generation. Here we address the issue of rapidly computing the likelihood function of CBC sources with non-spinning components. We show how to efficiently compute the continuous likelihood function on the three-dimensional subspace of parameters on which it has a non-trivial dependence (the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio and coalescence time) via interpolation. Subsequently, sampling this interpolated likelihood function is a significantly cheaper computational process than directly evaluating the likelihood; we report improvements in computational time of two to three orders of magnitude while keeping likelihoods accurate to < 0.025 %. Generating the interpolant of the likelihood function over a significant portion of the CBC mass space is computationally expensive but highly parallelizable, so the wall time can be very small relative to the time of a full parameter-estimation analysis.},

@article{Canizares2012,
abstract = {[abridged] The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio (EMRI) binaries, comprising a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a massive black hole, is one of the main targets for low-frequency gravitational-wave detectors in space, like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA or eLISA/NGO). The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted by such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive black hole, in which the inspiral occurs. The detection and analysis of EMRIs will therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and determine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even to test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the dynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative theories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational waves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or eLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a particular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified Gravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses approximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method and is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration space. This includes a Chern-Simons parameter that controls the strength of gravitational deviations from General Relativity. We find that, if Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified Gravity is the correct theory, an observatory like LISA or even eLISA/NGO should be able to measure the Chern-Simons parameter with fractional errors below 5%. If General Relativity is the true theory, these observatories should put bounds on this parameter at the level xi^(1/4) < 10^4 km, which is four orders of magnitude better than current Solar System bounds.},

It can be argued that the quintessence field should couple to this Chern-Simons term, and if so, it drives in the linearized theory a parity-violating interaction between the gravito-electric and gravitomagnetic fields. In this paper, the linearized spacetime for Chern-Simons gravity around a massive spinning body is found to include new modifications to the gravitomagnetic field that have not appeared in previous work. The orbits of test bodies and the precession of gyroscopes in this spacetime are calculated, leading to new constraints on the Chern-Simons parameter space due to current satellite experiments.},

Here we improve on these studies by (i) increasing the realism of injections and (ii) determining the optimal waveform families for detecting and characterizing such signals. We construct waveforms that deviate from those in General Relativity through a series of post-Newtonian terms, and find that these higher-order terms can affect our ability to test General Relativity, in some cases by making it easier to detect a deviation, and in some cases by making it more difficult. We find that simple single-phase post-Einsteinian waveforms are sufficient for detecting deviations from General Relativity, and there is little to be gained from using more complicated models with multiple phase terms. The results found here will help guide future attempts to test General Relativity with advanced ground-based detectors.},

Using the improved `algorithmic regularization' method of Hellstrom and Mikkola for compact subsystems, the new code NBODY7 enables for the first time general relativistic coalescence to be achieved for post-Newtonian terms and realistic parameters. Following an early stage of mass segregation, a few black holes form a small dense core which usually leads to the formation of one dominant binary. The subsequent evolution by dynamical shrinkage involves the competing processes of ejection and mergers by radiation energy loss. Unless the binary is ejected, long-lived triple systems often exhibit Kozai cycles with extremely high inner eccentricity (e > 0.999) which may terminate in coalescence at a few Schwarzschild radii. A characteristic feature is that ordinary stars as well as black holes and even BH binaries are ejected with high velocities. On the basis of the models studied so far, the results suggest a limited growth of a few remaining stellar mass black holes in globular clusters.},

abstract = {In 1676 Olaus R{\o}mer presented the first observational evidence for a finite light velocity $\cem$. He formed his estimate by attributing the periodically varying discrepancy between the observed and expected occultation times of the Galilean satellite Io by its planetary host Jupiter to the time it takes light to cross Earth's orbital diameter. Given a stable celestial clock that can be observed in gravitational waves the same principle can be used to measure the propagation speed $\cgw$ of gravitational radiation. Space-based "LISA"-like detectors will, and terrestrial LIGO-like detectors may, observe such clocks and thus be capable of directly measuring the propagation velocity of gravitational waves. In the case of space-based detectors the clocks will be galactic close white dwarf binary systems; in the case of terrestrial detectors, the most likely candidate clock is the periodic gravitational radiation from a rapidly rotating non-axisymmetric neutron star. Here we evaluate the accuracy that may be expected of such a R{\o}mer-type measurement of $\cgw$ by foreseeable future space-based and terrestrial detectors. For space-based, LISA-like detectors, periodic sources are plentiful: by the end of the first year of scientific operations a LISA-like detector will have measured $\cgw$ to better than a part in a thousand. Periodic sources may not be accessible in terrestrial detectors available to us in the foreseeable future; however, if such a source is detected then with a year of observations we could measure $\cgw$ to better than a part in a million.},

LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), a joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration and European Space Agency mission to be launched in the next decade, will perform these scientific tasks by detecting and studying low-frequency cosmic gravitational waves through their influence on the phases of six modulated laser beams exchanged between three remote spacecraft. By directly measuring the polarization components of the waves LISA will detect, we will be able to test Einstein’s theory of relativity with good sensitivity. Since a gravitational wave signal predicted by the most general relativistic metric theory of gravity accounts for six polarization modes (the usual two Einstein’s tensor polarizations as well as two vector and two scalar wave components), we have derived the LISA time-delay interferometric responses and estimated their sensitivities to vector- and scalar-type waves. We find that (i) at frequencies larger than roughly the inverse of the one-way light time (≈6×10-2Hz), LISA is more than ten times sensitive to scalar-longitudinal and vector signals than to tensor and scalar-transverse waves, and (ii) in the low part of its frequency band is equally sensitive to tensor and vector waves and somewhat less sensitive to scalar signals.},

While there is an emerging consensus about the origin and growth of supermassive black holes (with masses larger than a billion solar masses), MBHs with smaller masses such as the one in our galactic centre remain an understudied enigma. The key to understanding these holes, how some of them grow by orders of magnitude in mass is to understand the dynamics of the stars in the galactic neighborhood. Stars and the central MBH chiefly interact through the gradual inspiral of the stars into the MBH due to the emission of gravitational radiation. Also stars produce gases which will be subsequently accreted by the MBH by collisions and disruptions brought about by the strong central tidal field. Such processes can contribute significantly to the mass of the MBH and progress in understanding them requires theoretical work in preparation for future gravitational radiation millihertz missions and X-ray observatories. In particular, a unique probe of these regions is the gravitational radiation that is emitted by some compact stars very close to the black holes and which will could be surveyed by a millihertz gravitational wave interferometer scrutinizing the range of masses fundamental to the understanding of the origin and growth of supermassive black holes. By extracting the information carried by the gravitational radiation, we can determine the mass and spin of the central MBH with unprecedented precision and we can determine how the holes "eat" stars that happen to be near them.},

abstract = {The nonlinear gravitational-wave memory causes a time-varying but nonoscillatory correction to the gravitational-wave polarizations. It arises from gravitational-waves that are sourced by gravitational-waves. Previous considerations of the nonlinear memory effect have focused on quasicircular binaries. Here I consider the nonlinear memory from Newtonian orbits with arbitrary eccentricity. Expressions for the waveform polarizations and spin-weighted spherical-harmonic modes are derived for elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic, and radial orbits. In the hyperbolic, parabolic, and radial cases the nonlinear memory provides a 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) correction to the leading-order waveforms. This is in contrast to the elliptical and quasicircular cases, where the nonlinear memory corrects the waveform at leading (0PN) order. This difference in PN order arises from the fact that the memory builds up over a short "scattering" timescale in the hyperbolic case, as opposed to a much longer radiation-reaction timescale in the elliptical case. The nonlinear memory corrections presented here complete our knowledge of the leading-order (Peters-Mathews) waveforms for elliptical orbits. These calculations are also relevant for binaries with quasicircular orbits in the present epoch which had, in the past, large eccentricities. Because the nonlinear memory depends sensitively on the past evolution of a binary, I discuss the effect of this early-time eccentricity on the value of the late-time memory in nearly-circularized binaries. I also discuss the observability of large "memory jumps" in a binary's past that could arise from its formation in a capture process. Lastly, I provide estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio of the linear and nonlinear memories from hyperbolic and parabolic binaries.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics around rotating black holes is imperative to the success of future gravitational wave observatories. Although integrable in principle, test-particle orbits in the Kerr spacetime can also be elaborate, and while they have been studied extensively, classifying their general properties has been a challenge. This is the first in a series of papers that adopts a dynamical systems approach to the study of Kerr orbits, beginning with equatorial orbits. We define a taxonomy of orbits that hinges on a correspondence between periodic orbits and rational numbers. The taxonomy defines the entire dynamics, including aperiodic motion, since every orbit is in or near the periodic set. A remarkable implication of this periodic orbit taxonomy is that the simple precessing ellipse familiar from planetary orbits is not allowed in the strong-field regime. Instead, eccentric orbits trace out precessions of multileaf clovers in the final stages of inspiral. Furthermore, for any black hole, there is some point in the strong-field regime past which zoom-whirl behavior becomes unavoidable. Finally, we sketch the potential application of the taxonomy to problems of astrophysical interest, in particular its utility for computationally intensive gravitational wave calculations.},

abstract = {We propose a thermodynamically motivated measure of gravitational entropy based on the Bel-Robinson tensor, which has a natural interpretation as the effective super-energy-momentum tensor of free gravitational fields. The specific form of this measure differs depending on whether the gravitational field is Coulomb-like or wave-like, and reduces to the Bekenstein-Hawking value when integrated over the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. For scalar perturbations of a Robertson-Walker geometry we find that the entropy goes like the Hubble weighted anisotropy of the gravitational field, and therefore increases as structure formation occurs. This is in keeping with our expectations for the behaviour of gravitational entropy in cosmology, and provides a thermodynamically motivated arrow of time for cosmological solutions of Einstein's field equations. It is also in keeping with Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis.},

abstract = {The study of how stars distribute themselves around a massive black hole (MBH) in the center of a galaxy is an important prerequisite for the understanding of many galactic-center processes. These include the observed overabundance of point X-ray sources at the Galactic center, the prediction of rates and characteristics of tidal disruptions of extended stars by the MBH and of inspirals of compact stars into the MBH, the latter being events of high importance for the future space borne gravitational wave interferometer LISA. In relatively small galactic nuclei, hosting MBHs with masses in the range 10^5-10^7 Msun, the single most important dynamical process is 2-body relaxation. It induces the formation of a steep density cusp around the MBH and strong mass segregation, as more massive stars lose energy to lighter ones and drift to the central regions. Using a spherical stellar dynamical Monte-Carlo code, we simulate the long-term relaxational evolution of galactic nucleus models with a spectrum of stellar masses. Our focus is the concentration of stellar black holes to the immediate vicinity of the MBH. We quantify this mass segregation for a variety of galactic nucleus models and discuss its astrophysical implications. Special attention is given to models developed to match the conditions in the Milky Way nucleus; we examine the presence of compact objects in connection to recent high-resolution X-ray observations.},

abstract = {The massive black holes we observe in galaxies today are the natural end-product of a complex evolutionary path, in which black holes seeded in proto-galaxies at high redshift grow through cosmic history via a sequence of mergers and accretion episodes. Electromagnetic observations probe a small subset of the population of massive black holes (namely, those that are active or those that are very close to us), but planned space-based gravitational-wave observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can measure the parameters of ``electromagnetically invisible'' massive black holes out to high redshift. In this paper we introduce a Bayesian framework to analyze the information that can be gathered from a set of such measurements. Our goal is to connect a set of massive black hole binary merger observations to the underlying model of massive black hole formation. In other words, given a set of observed massive black hole coalescences, we assess what information can be extracted about the underlying massive black hole population model. For concreteness we consider ten specific models of massive black hole formation, chosen to probe four important (and largely unconstrained) aspects of the input physics used in structure formation simulations: seed formation, metallicity ``feedback'', accretion efficiency and accretion geometry. For the first time we allow for the possibility of ``model mixing'', by drawing the observed population from some combination of the ``pure'' models that have been simulated. A Bayesian analysis allows us to recover a posterior probability distribution for the ``mixing parameters'' that characterize the fractions of each model represented in the observed distribution. Our work shows that LISA has enormous potential to probe the underlying physics of structure formation.},

abstract = {A wealth of astronomical data indicate the presence of mass discrepancies in the Universe. The motions observed in a variety of classes of extragalactic systems exceed what can be explained by the mass visible in stars and gas. Either (i) there is a vast amount of unseen mass in some novel form - dark matter - or (ii) the data indicate a breakdown of our understanding of dynamics on the relevant scales, or (iii) both. Here, we first review a few outstanding challenges for the dark matter interpretation of mass discrepancies in galaxies, purely based on observations and independently of any alternative theoretical framework. We then show that many of these puzzling observations are predicted by one single relation - Milgrom's law - involving an acceleration constant (or a characteristic surface density) of the order of the square-root of the cosmological constant in natural units. This relation can at present most easily be interpreted as the effect of a single universal force law resulting from a modification of Newtonian dynamics (MOND) on galactic scales. We exhaustively review the current observational successes and problems of this alternative paradigm at all astrophysical scales, and summarize the various theoretical attempts (TeVeS, GEA, BIMOND, and others) made to effectively embed this modification of Newtonian dynamics within a relativistic theory of gravity.},

abstract = {In one widely discussed model for the formation of nuclear star clusters (NSCs), massive globular clusters spiral into the center of a galaxy and merge to form the nucleus. It is now known that at least some NSCs coexist with supermassive black holes (SBHs); this is the case, for instance, in the Milky Way (MW). In this paper, we investigate how the presence of a SMBH at the center of the MW impacts the merger hypothesis for the formation of its NSC. Starting from a model consisting of a low-density nuclear stellar disk and the SMBH, we use N-body simulations to follow the successive inspiral and merger of (12) globular clusters. The clusters are started on circular orbits of radius 20 pc, and their initial masses and radii are set up in such a way as to be consistent with the galactic tidal field at that radius. The total accumulated mass is about 1.5x10^7 Solar masses. Each cluster is disrupted by the SMBH at a distance of roughly one parsec. The density profile that results after the final inspiral event is characterized by a core of roughly this radius, and an envelope with density that falls off rho \sim r^-2. These properties are similar to those of the MW NSC, with the exception of the core size, which in the MW is a little smaller. But by continuing the evolution of the model after the final inspiral event, we find that the core shrinks substantially via gravitational encounters in a time (when scaled to the MW) of 10 Gyr as the stellar distribution evolves toward a Bahcall-Wolf cusp. We also show that the luminosity function of the MW NSC is consistent with the hypothesis that a large fraction of the mass comes from ($\sim$10Gyr) old stars, brought in by globular clusters. We conclude that a model in which a large fraction of the mass of the MW NSC arose from infalling globular clusters is consistent with existing observational constraints.},

abstract = {The "no hair" theorem, a key result in General Relativity, states that an isolated black hole is defined by only three parameters: mass, angular momentum, and electric charge; this asymptotic state is reached on a light-crossing time scale. We find that the "no hair" theorem is not formally applicable for black holes formed from collapse of a rotating neutron star. Rotating neutron stars can self-produce particles via vacuum breakdown forming a highly conducting plasma magnetosphere such that magnetic field lines are effectively "frozen-in" the star both before and during collapse. In the limit of no resistivity, this introduces a topological constraint which prohibits the magnetic field from sliding off the newly-formed event horizon. As a result, during collapse of a neutron star into a black hole, the latter conserves the number of magnetic flux tubes $N_B = e \Phi_\infty /(\pi c \hbar)$, where $\Phi_\infty \approx 2 \pi^2 B_{NS} R_{NS}^3 /(P_{\rm NS} c)$ is the initial magnetic flux through the hemispheres of the progenitor and out to infinity. We test this theoretical result via three-dimensional general relativistic plasma simulations of rotating black holes that start with a neutron star dipole magnetic field with no currents initially present outside the event horizon. The black hole's magnetosphere subsequently relaxes to the split monopole magnetic field geometry with self-generated currents outside the event horizon. The dissipation of the resulting equatorial current sheet leads to a slow loss of the anchored flux tubes, a process that balds the black hole on long resistive time scales rather than the short light-crossing time scales expected from the vacuum "no-hair" theorem.},

abstract = {We explore the prospects for constraining cosmology using gravitational wave (GW) observations of neutron star binaries by the proposed Einstein Telescope (ET), exploiting the narrowness of the neutron star mass function. Double neutron star (DNS) binaries are expected to be one of the first sources detected after "first-light" of Advanced LIGO and are expected to be detected at a rate of a few tens per year in the advanced era. However the proposed Einstein Telescope (ET) could catalogue tens of thousands per year. Combining the measured source redshift distributions with GW-network distance determinations will permit not only the precision measurement of background cosmological parameters, but will provide an insight into the astrophysical properties of these DNS systems. Of particular interest will be to probe the distribution of delay times between DNS-binary creation and subsequent merger, as well as the evolution of the star-formation rate density within ET's detection horizon. Keeping H_0, Omega_{m,0} and Omega_{\Lambda,0} fixed and investigating the precision with which the dark energy equation-of-state parameters could be recovered, we found that with 10^5 detected DNS binaries we could constrain these parameters to an accuracy similar to forecasted constraints from future CMB+BAO+SNIa measurements. Furthermore, modeling the merger delay-time distribution as a power-law, and the star-formation rate (SFR) density as a parametrised version of the Porciani and Madau SF2 model, we find that the associated astrophysical parameters are constrained to within $\sim$ 10%. All parameter precisions scaled as 1/sqrt(N), where N is the number of catalogued detections. We also investigated how precisions varied with the intrinsic underlying properties of the Universe and with the distance reach of the network (which may be affected by the lower frequency cutoff of the detector).},

Recent observations have uncovered both massive and low-mass neutron stars and have also set constraints on neutron star radii. The largest mass measurements are powerfully influencing the high-density equation of state because of the existence of the neutron star maximum mass. The smallest mass measurements, and the distributions of masses, have implications for the progenitors and formation mechanisms of neutron stars. The ensemble of mass and radius observations can realistically restrict the properties of dense matter, and, in particular, the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy near the nuclear saturation density. Simultaneously, various nuclear experiments are progressively restricting the ranges of parameters describing the symmetry properties of the nuclear equation of state. In addition, new theoretical studies of pure neutron matter are providing insights. These observational, experimental and theoretical constraints of dense matter, when combined, are now revealing a remarkable convergence.},

In this paper, we calculate the profiles of fluorescent iron lines emitted from the accretion flows around black holes within a framework that allows us to perform the calculation as a function of the mass and spin of a black hole as well as of a free parameter that measures potential deviations from the Kerr metric. We show that such deviations lead to line profiles that are significantly altered and exhibit a modified flux ratio of the two peaks in their characteristic double-peaked shape. We estimate the precision that near-future X-ray missions such as Astro-H and ATHENA are required to achieve in order to resolve deviations from the Kerr metric in iron line profiles and show that constraints on such deviations will be strongest for rapidly spinning black holes. More generally, we show that measuring the line profile with a precision of $\sim$5% at a disk inclination of 30{\deg} constraints the deviation parameter to order unity irrespectively of the spin of the black hole.},

abstract = {Using a statistically rigorous analysis method, we place limits on the existence of an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background using pulsar timing observations. We consider backgrounds whose characteristic strain spectra may be described as a power-law dependence with frequency. Such backgrounds include an astrophysical background produced by coalescing supermassive black-hole binary systems and cosmological backgrounds due to relic gravitational waves and cosmic strings. Using the best available data, we obtain an upper limit on the energy density per unit logarithmic frequency interval of $\Omega$SMBHg[1/(8 yr)h2<=1.9×10-8 for an astrophysical background that is 5 times more stringent than the earlier limit of 1.1×10-7 found by Kaspi and colleagues. We also provide limits on a background due to relic gravitational waves and cosmic strings of $\Omega$relicg[1/(8 yr)h2<=2.0×10-8 and $\Omega$csg[1/(8 yr)h2<=1.9×10-8, respectively. All of the quoted upper limits correspond to a 0.1% false alarm rate together with a 95% detection rate. We discuss the physical implications of these results and highlight the future possibilities of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project. We find that our current results can (1) constrain the merger rate of supermassive binary black hole systems at high redshift, (2) rule out some relationships between the black hole mass and the galactic halo mass, (3) constrain the rate of expansion in the inflationary era, and (4) provide an upper bound on the dimensionless tension of a cosmic string background.},

abstract = {Black holes in General Relativity are known as Kerr black holes and are characterized solely by two parameters, the mass $M$ and the spin $J$. All the higher multipole moments of the gravitational field are functions of these two parameters. For instance, the quadrupole moment is $Q=-J^2/M$, which implies that a measurement of $M$, $J$, and $Q$ for black hole candidates would allow one to test whether these objects are really black holes as described by General Relativity. While future gravitational-wave experiments will be able to test the Kerr nature of these objects with very high accuracy, in this paper we show that it is possible to put constraints on the quadrupole moment of stellar-mass black hole candidates by using presently available X-ray data of the thermal spectrum of their accretion disk.},

abstract = {We present a study of the central engine in the broad-line radio galaxy 3C120 using a multi-epoch analysis of a deep XMM-Newton observation and two deep Suzaku pointings (in 2012). In order to place our spectral data into the context of the disk-disruption/jet-ejection cycles displayed by this object, we monitor the source in the UV/X-ray bands, and in the radio band. We find three statistically acceptable spectral models, a disk-reflection model, a jet-model and a jet+disk model. Despite being good descriptions of the data, the disk-reflection model violates the radio constraints on the inclination, and the jet-model has a fine-tuning problem, requiring a jet contribution exceeding that expected. Thus, we argue for a composite jet+disk model. Within the context of this model, we verify the basic predictions of the jet-cycle paradigm, finding a truncated/refilling disk during the Suzaku observations and a complete disk extending down to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) during the XMM-Newton observation. The idea of a refilling disk is further supported by the detection of the ejection of a new jet knot approximately one month after the Suzaku pointings. We also discover a step-like event in one of the Suzaku pointings in which the soft band lags the hard band. We suggest that we are witnessing the propagation of a disturbance from the disk into the jet on a timescale set by the magnetic field.},

We create procedures to construct viable LCDM-like f(R) models, and present multiple models of three types. The connections between some of these models are discussed. We also study the cosmological evolution of the LCDM-like f(R) gravity. Exact numerical integration can generate accurate cosmological evolution, but the numerical simulation in the early-universe stage is slow due to the oscillations of the field phi(= f') near the minimum of the effective potential. To avoid this problem, we take the minimum of the effective potential as an approximate solution for phi, and obtain the cosmological evolution. This approximate method describes the cosmological evolution well except in the late universe. Therefore, we use the approximate method in the early-universe evolution, and use the exact method in the late-universe one.},

From the photometry of the resolved brighter stars in this galaxy, 11 Cepheids with periods ranging between 12 and 90 days have been identified. The true distance modulus has been derived from the apparent distance moduli in g, r, and i. The distance modulus is 28.02+/-0.18 based on the LMC period-luminosity (P-L) relation of Sandage, Reindl, &amp; Tammann; this corresponds to a distance of 4.0+/-0.3 Mpc. Using the P-L relation from Madore &amp; Freedman, the distance modulus is 28.15+/-0.18, which corresponds to a distance of 4.3+/-0.4 Mpc. The reddening is calculated to be E(g-r)=0.06+/-0.08 and E(r-i)=0.10+/-0.08, again from the distance moduli $\mu$g, $\mu$r, and $\mu$i. In addition, 37 other variables have been detected, the majority of which have definite periods; they are probably all red long-period variables.},

abstract = {We present the results of 16 years of monitoring stellar orbits around the massive black hole in center of the Milky Way using high resolution NIR techniques. This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric accuracy of 300 microarcsecond, and by investigating in detail the individual systematic error contributions. The combination of a long time baseline and the excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allow us to determine orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits are fit extremely well by a single point mass potential to within the astrometric uncertainties, which are now 6 times better than in previous studies. The central object mass is (4.31 +- 0.06|stat +- 0.36|R0) * 10^6 M_sun where the fractional statistical error of 1.5 percent is nearly independent from R0 and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R0. Our current best estimate for the distance to the Galactic Center is R0 = 8.33 +- 0.35 kpc. The dominant errors in this value is systematic. The mass scales with distance as (3.95 +- 0.06) * 10^6 M_sun * (R0/8kpc)^2.19. The orientations of orbital angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six of the stars with orbital solutions as late type stars, and six early-type stars as members of the clockwise rotating disk system, as was previously proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter and apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99% confidence level, of the mass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would expect from other theoretical and observational estimates.},

abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z$\sim$6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z$\sim$20 from high-$\sigma$ density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1<z<5. A scheme for describing the hardening of a BH binary in a stellar background with core formation due to mass ejection is applied, where the stellar cusp proportional to r-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing <$\sim$10% to the total BH mass density, $\rho$SMBH=4×105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10% today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than 0.1L*) instead is less than 0.3% at all epochs. The nuclear SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 $\sigma$ (4 $\sigma$) density peaks at z=20.},

abstract = {We present the spectrum of compact object masses: neutron stars and black holes (BHs) that originate from single stars in different environments. In particular, we calculate the dependence of maximum BH mass on metallicity and on some specific wind mass loss rates (e.g., Hurley et al. and Vink et al.). Our calculations show that the highest mass BHs observed in the Galaxy M bh $\sim$ 15 M sun in the high metallicity environment (Z = Z sun = 0.02) can be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here. To reach this result we had to set luminous blue variable mass loss rates at the level of $\sim$10-4 M sun yr-1 and to employ metallicity-dependent Wolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic BH mass measurements, the maximum BH mass obtained for moderate metallicity (Z = 0.3 Z sun = 0.006) is M bh,max = 30 M sun. This is a rather striking finding as the mass of the most massive known stellar BH is M bh = 23-34 M sun and, in fact, it is located in a small star-forming galaxy with moderate metallicity. We find that in the very low (globular cluster-like) metallicity environment the maximum BH mass can be as high as M bh,max = 80 M sun (Z = 0.01 Z sun = 0.0002). It is interesting to note that X-ray luminosity from Eddington-limited accretion onto an 80 M sun BH is of the order of $\sim$1040 erg s-1 and is comparable to luminosities of some known ultra-luminous X-ray sources. We emphasize that our results were obtained for single stars only and that binary interactions may alter these maximum BH masses (e.g., accretion from a close companion). This is strictly a proof-of-principle study which demonstrates that stellar models can naturally explain even the most massive known stellar BHs.},

abstract = {Observations show that the central black hole in galaxies has a mass M of only $\sim$10-3 of the stellar bulge mass. Thus, whatever process grows the black hole also promotes star formation with far higher efficiency. We interpret this in terms of the generic tendency of active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion discs to become self-gravitating outside some small radius Rsg $\sim$ 0.01-0.1 pc from the black hole. We argue that mergers consist of sequences of such episodes, each limited by self-gravity to a mass $\Delta$Mepisode $\sim$ 10-3 M, with angular momentum characteristic of the small part of the accretion flow which formed it. In this picture, a major merger with $\Delta$Mmerger $\sim$ M gives rise to a long series of low-mass accretion disc episodes, all chaotically oriented with respect to one another. Thus, the angular momentum vector oscillates randomly during the accretion process, on mass-scales $\sim$ 103 times smaller than the total mass accreted in a major merger event. We show that for essentially all AGN parameters, the disc produced by any accretion episode of this type has lower angular momentum than the hole, allowing stable co- and counter-alignment of the discs through the Lense-Thirring effect. A sequence of randomly oriented accretion episodes as envisaged above then produces accretion discs stably co- or counter-aligned with the black hole spin with almost equal frequency. Accretion from these discs very rapidly adjusts the hole's spin parameter to average values (the precise range depending slightly on the disc vertical viscosity coefficient $\alpha$2) from any initial conditions, but with significant fluctuations ($\Delta$a $\sim$ +/-0.2) about these. We conclude that (i) supermassive black holes (SMBH) should on average spin moderately, with the mean value decreasing slowly as the mass increases; (ii) SMBH coalescences leave little long-term effect on ; (iii) SMBH coalescence products in general have modest recoil velocities, so that there is little likelihood of their being ejected from the host galaxy; (iv) black holes can grow even from stellar masses to $\sim$5 × 109Msolar at high redshift z $\sim$ 6; and (v) jets produced in successive accretion episodes can have similar directions, but after several episodes the jet direction deviates significantly. Rare examples of massive holes with larger spin parameters could result from prograde coalescences with SMBHs of similar mass, and are most likely to be found in giant ellipticals. We compare these results with observation.},

abstract = {We derive the universal distribution of signal-to-noise ratios for gravitational wave detection. Because gravitational waves (GWs) are almost impossible to obscure via dust absorption or other astrophysical processes, the strength of the detected signal is dictated solely by the emission strength and the distance to the source. Assuming that the space density of an arbitrary population of GW sources does not evolve, the distribution of detected signal-to-noise (SNR) values depends solely on the detection threshold; it is independent of the detector network (interferometer or pulsar timing array), the individual detector noise curves (initial or Advanced LIGO), the nature of the GW sources (compact binary coalescence, supernova, or some other discrete source), and the distributions of source variables such as the binary masses and spins (only non-spinning neutron stars of mass exactly $1.4\,M_\odot$ or a complicated distribution of masses and spins). We also derive the SNR distribution for each individual detector within a network as a function of the relative detector orientations and sensitivities. While most detections will have SNR near the detection threshold, there will be a tail of events to higher SNR. We derive the SNR distribution of the loudest (highest SNR) events in any given sample of detections. We find that in 50% of cases the loudest event out of the first four should have an SNR louder than 22 (for a threshold of 12, appropriate for the Advanced LIGO/Virgo network), increasing to a loudest SNR of 47 for 40 detections. We expect these loudest events to provide particularly powerful constraints on their source parameters, and they will play an important role in extracting astrophysics from gravitational wave sources. These distributions also offer an important internal calibration of the response of the GW detector networks.},

abstract = {The differing Mbh -L relations presented in McLure &amp; Dunlop, Marconi &amp; Hunt and Erwin et al. have been investigated. A number of issues have been identified and addressed in each of these studies, including but not limited to the removal of a dependency on the Hubble constant, a correction for dust attenuation in the bulges of disc galaxies, the identification of lenticular galaxies previously treated as elliptical galaxies and the application of the same (Y | X) regression analysis. These adjustments result in relations which now predict similar black hole masses. The optimal K-band relation is log(Mbh/Msolar) = -0.37(+/-0.04)(MK + 24) + 8.29(+/-0.08), with a total (not intrinsic) scatter in logMbh equal to 0.33dex. This level of scatter is similar to the value of 0.34dex from the relation of Tremaine et al. and compares favourably with the value of 0.31dex from the Mbh -n relation of Graham &amp; Driver. Using different photometric data, consistent relations in the B and R band are also provided, although we do note that the small (N = 13) R-band sample used by Erwin et al. is found here to have a slope of -0.30 +/- 0.06. Performing a symmetrical regression on the larger K-band sample gives a slope of $\sim$ -0.40, implying Mbh $\sim$ L1.00. Implications for galaxy-black hole co-evolution, in terms of dry mergers, are briefly discussed, as are the predictions for intermediate mass black holes. Finally, as noted by others, a potential bias in the galaxy sample used to define the Mbh -L relations is shown and a corrective formula provided.},

abstract = {Efforts to place limits on deviations from canonical formulations of electromagnetism and gravity have probed length scales increasing dramatically over time. Historically, these studies have passed through three stages: (1) testing the power in the inverse-square laws of Newton and Coulomb, (2) seeking a nonzero value for the rest mass of photon or graviton, and (3) considering more degrees of freedom, allowing mass while preserving explicit gauge or general-coordinate invariance. Since the previous review the lower limit on the photon Compton wavelength has improved by four orders of magnitude, to about one astronomical unit, and rapid current progress in astronomy makes further advance likely. For gravity there have been vigorous debates about even the concept of graviton rest mass. Meanwhile there are striking observations of astronomical motions that do not fit Einstein gravity with visible sources. “Cold dark matter” (slow, invisible classical particles) fits well at large scales. “Modified Newtonian dynamics” provides the best phenomenology at galactic scales. Satisfying this phenomenology is a requirement if dark matter, perhaps as invisible classical fields, could be correct here too. “Dark energy” might be explained by a graviton-mass-like effect, with associated Compton wavelength comparable to the radius of the visible universe. Significant mass limits are summarized in a table.},

abstract = {The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detectors will begin operation in the coming years, with compact binary coalescence events a likely source for the first detections. The gravitational waveforms emitted directly encode information about the sources, including the masses and spins of the compact objects. Recovering the physical parameters of the sources from the GW observations is a key analysis task. This work describes the LALInference software library for Bayesian parameter estimation of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, which builds on several previous methods to provide a well-tested toolkit which has already been used for several studies. We are able to show using three independent sampling algorithms that our implementation consistently converges on the same results, giving confidence in the parameter estimates thus obtained.   We demonstrate this with a detailed comparison on three compact binary systems: a binary neutron star, a neutron star-black hole binary and a binary black hole, where we show a cross-comparison of results. These systems were analysed with non-spinning, aligned spin and generic spin configurations respectively, showing that consistent results can be obtained even with the full 15-dimensional parameter space of the generic spin configurations. We also demonstrate statistically that the Bayesian credible intervals we recover correspond to frequentist confidence intervals under correct prior assumptions by analysing a set of 100 signals drawn from the prior.   We discuss the computational cost of these algorithms, and describe the general and problem-specific sampling techniques we have used to improve the efficiency of sampling the CBC parameter space.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present an updated and improved M_bh-sigma diagram containing 64 galaxies for which M_bh measurements (not just upper limits) are available. Due to new and increased black hole masses at the high-mass end, and a better representation of barred galaxies at the low-mass end, the "classical" (all morphological type) M_bh-sigma relation for predicting black hole masses is log(M_bh/M_Sun) = (5.13+/-0.34)log[sigma/200] + (8.13+/-0.05), with an rms scatter of 0.43 dex. Modifying the regression analysis to correct for a hitherto over-looked sample bias in which black holes with masses <10^6 M_Sun are not (yet) detectable, the relation steepens further to give log(M_bh/M_Sun) = (5.95+/-0.44)log[sigma/200] + (8.15+/-0.06). We have also updated the "barless" and "elliptical-only" M_bh-sigma relations introduced by Graham and Hu in 2008 due to the offset nature of barred/disc galaxies. These relations have a total scatter as low as 0.34 dex and currently define the upper envelope of points in the M_bh-sigma diagram. These relations also have a slope consistent with the value 5, in agreement with the prediction by Silk & Rees based on feedback from massive black holes in bulges built by monolithic-collapse. Using updated virial products and velocity dispersions from 28 active galactic nuclei, we determine that the optimal scaling factor f - which brings their virial products in line with the 64 directly measured black hole masses - is 2.8^{+0.7}_{-0.5}. This is roughly half the value reported by Onken et al. and Woo et al., and consequently halves the mass estimates of most high-redshift quasars. We have explored the results after separating the samples into barred and non-barred galaxies, and we have also developed a preliminary corrective term to the velocity dispersion based on bar dynamics.},

abstract = {We consider the orbital evolution of the S-stars, the young main-sequence stars near the supermassive black hole (SBH) at the Galactic center (GC), and put constraints on competing models for their origin. Our analysis includes for the first time the joint effects of Newtonian and relativistic perturbations to the motion, including the dragging of inertial frames by a spinning SBH as well as torques due to finite-N asymmetries in the field-star distribution (resonant relaxation, RR). The evolution of the S-star orbits is strongly influenced by the Schwarzschild barrier (SB), the locus in the (E,L) plane where RR is ineffective at driving orbits to higher eccentricities. Formation models that invoke tidal disruption of binary stars by the SBH tend to place stars below (i.e., at higher eccentricities than) the SB; some stars remain below the barrier, but most stars are able to penetrate it, after which they are subject to RR and achieve a nearly thermal distribution of eccentricities. This process requires roughly 50 Myr in nuclear models with relaxed stellar cusps, or >$\sim$10 Myr, regardless of the initial distribution of eccentricities, in nuclear models that include a dense cluster of 10 M_Sun black holes. We find a probability of <$\sim$1% for any S-star to be tidally disrupted by the SBH over its lifetime.},

abstract = {The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is used in gravitational-wave observations as the basic figure of merit for detection confidence and, together with the Fisher matrix, for the amount of physical information that can be extracted from a detected signal. SNRs are usually computed from a sensitivity curve, which describes the gravitational-wave amplitude needed by a monochromatic source of given frequency to achieve a threshold SNR. For interferometric space-based detectors similar to LISA, which are sensitive to long-lived signals and have constantly changing position and orientation, exact SNRs need to be computed on a source-by-source basis. For convenience, most authors prefer to work with sky-averaged sensitivities, accepting inaccurate SNRs for individual sources and giving up control over the statistical distribution of SNRs for source populations. In this paper, we describe a straightforward end-to-end recipe to compute the non-sky-averaged sensitivity of interferometric space-based detectors of any geometry, and we use it to generate a sampling distribution of sensitivities for a given source population. In effect, we derive error bars for the sky-averaged sensitivity curve. As a worked-out example, we consider isotropic and Galactic-disk populations of monochromatic sources, as observed with the "classic LISA" configuration. We confirm that the (standard) inverse-rms average sensitivity for the isotropic population remains the same whether or not the LISA orbits are included in the computation. However, detector motion tightens the distribution of sensitivities, so for 50% of sources the sensitivity is within 30% of its average. For the Galactic-disk population, the average and distribution of the sensitivity for a moving detector turn out to be similar to the isotropic case.},

The results of numerical simulations based on a simple homological model for the evolution of a cluster up to the point of catastrophic collapse are presented in extensive graphs and characterized in detail. It is shown that gravitational radiation begins to have a significant effect long before the onset of the high-redshift state. In the later stages, radiative dissipation from binary captures and flyby orbits acts to increase the final core mass that can undergo catastrophic collapse. Realistic initial conditions are found to lead to final cores of 100-100,000 solar masses, which can then collapse in a few dynamical time scales to form black holes 10-150 times larger. It is suggested that gravitational radiation from compact-star binaries may be detectable by ground-based interferometers.},

Such a model makes it possible to study the gravitational and cosmological consequences of preferred frame effects, such as ``variable speed of light" or high frequency dispersion, while preserving a generally covariant metric theory of gravity. In this paper we restrict attention to an action for an effective theory of the aether which involves only the antisymmetrized derivative $\nabla_{[a}u_{b]}$. Without matter this theory is equivalent to a sector of the Einstein-Maxwell-charged dust system. The aether has two massless transverse excitations, and the solutions of the model include all vacuum solutions of general relativity (as well as other solutions). However, the aether generally develops gradient singularities which signal a breakdown of this effective theory. Including the symmetrized derivative in the action for the aether field may cure this problem.},

When the misalignment angles are large (>30 degrees), the detection efficiency of the coalescence events can decrease significantly if the misalignment effects are not modeled. In this paper, we consider the formation of close compact binaries and calculate the expected misalignment angles after the second core collapse event. Depending on the progenitor parameters and the assumptions made about supernova kicks, we find that 30 to 80 per cent of binaries containing a black hole and a neutron star that coalesce within 10 billion years have misalignment angles larger than 30 degrees and a significant fraction of them could remain undetected. The calculations allow us to place strong constraints on the progenitors of such binaries and the kick magnitudes required for their formation. We also discuss the formation of close binaries with two black holes and the effect of non-isotropic kicks.},

abstract = {We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M_•. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M_• and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon $\sim$ L^0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95% confidence level an MDO of mass M_• $\sim$ 0.006M_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M_• = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M_•. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f $\sim$= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M_•/M_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation $\sim$0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M_• is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M_bulge.},

abstract = {The $5 - 20 M_\odot$ dark objects in X-ray binary systems and the $10^5 - 10^9 M_\odot$ dark objects in galactic nuclei are currently thought to be the Kerr black holes predicted by General Relativity. However, direct observational evidence for this identification is still elusive, and the only viable approach to confirm the Kerr black hole hypothesis is to explore and rule out any other possibility. Here we investigate the final stages of the accretion process onto generic compact objects. While for Kerr black holes and for more oblate bodies the accreting gas reaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and plunges into the compact object, we find that for more prolate bodies several scenarios are possible, depending on the spacetime geometry. In particular, we find examples in which the gas reaches the ISCO, but then gets trapped between the ISCO and the compact object. In this situation, accretion onto the compact object is possible only if the gas loses additional angular momentum, forming torus-like structures inside the ISCO.},

abstract = {During the inspiral and merger of black holes, the interaction of gravitational wave multipoles carries linear momentum away, thereby providing an astrophysically important recoil, or "kick" to the system and to the final black hole remnant. It has been found that linear momentum during the last stage (quasinormal ringing) of the collapse tends to provide an "antikick" that in some cases cancels almost all the kick from the earlier (quasicircular inspiral) emission. We show here that this cancellation is not due to peculiarities of gravitational waves, black holes, or interacting multipoles, but simply to the fact that the rotating flux of momentum changes its intensity slowly. We show furthermore that an understanding of the systematics of the emission allows good estimates of the net kick for numerical simulations started at fairly late times, and is useful for understanding qualitatively what kinds of systems provide large and small net kicks.},

@article{Antognini2013,
abstract = {Abridged: The Kozai-Lidov (KL) mechanism can accelerate the merger of compact objects via gravitational radiation by driving the inner binaries of hierarchical triples to high eccentricities. We perform direct three-body integrations of a range of high mass ratio ($\sim$100:1) compact object triple systems undergoing KL oscillations using Fewbody and including post-Newtonian terms up to order 3.5. We find that the inner binary undergoes rapid eccentricity oscillations (REOs) on the timescale of the outer orbital period which drive it to higher eccentricities than secular theory would otherwise predict and results in substantially reduced merger times. For a uniform distribution of tertiary eccentricity (e_2), we show that $\sim$40% of systems merge within $\sim$1-2 eccentric KL timescales whereas secular theory predicts that only $\sim$20% of such systems merge that rapidly. The merger time discrepancy between secular theory and the full three-body dynamics becomes especially pronounced at low e_2, with secular theory overpredicting the merger time by many orders of magnitude. We note that $\sim$10% of compact object binaries driven to merger by the eccentric KL mechanism retain non-negligible eccentricity (e > 0.8) when they emit gravitational waves at frequencies detectable by LIGO or LISA for the relevant range of masses, which could have an impact in the residual eccentricity at merger. Our results are applicable to all high mass ratio triple systems containing black holes (of any mass) or neutron stars because our calculations are dimensionless when relativistic corrections are negligible. In physically larger objects in which tidal effects are important, such as white dwarfs, stars, and planets, REOs can reduce the tidal circularization timescale by an order of magnitude and bring the components of the inner binary into closer orbits than would be possible in the secular approximation.},

abstract = {The upcoming detection of gravitational waves by terrestrial interferometers will usher in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. This will be particularly true when space-based detectors will come of age and measure the mass and spin of massive black holes with exquisite precision and up to very high redshifts, thus allowing for better understanding of the symbiotic evolution of black holes with galaxies, and for high-precision tests of General Relativity in strong-field, highly-dynamical regimes. Such ambitious goals require that astrophysical environmental pollution of gravitational-wave signals be constrained to negligible levels, so that neither detection nor estimation of the source parameters are significantly affected. Here, we consider the main sources for space-based detectors -the inspiral, merger and ringdown of massive black-hole binaries and extreme mass-ratio inspirals- and account for various effects on their gravitational waveforms, including electromagnetic fields, cosmological evolution, accretion disks, dark matter, ``firewalls'' and possible deviations from General Relativity. We discover that the black-hole quasinormal modes are sharply different in the presence of matter than in vacuum, but the ringdown signal observed by interferometers is typically unaffected. The effect of accretion disks and dark matter depends critically on their geometry and density profile, but is negligible for most sources, except for very few special extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Electromagnetic fields and cosmological effects are always negligible. We finally explore the implications of our findings for proposed tests of General Relativity with gravitational waves, and conclude that environmental effects will not prevent the development of precision gravitational-wave astronomy.},

In all of the cases studied, we find that it is impossible to satisfy the required junction conditions without the large-scale behaviour reducing to that expected from Einstein's equations with a cosmological constant. For theories with analytic f(R) this suggests that the usual treatment of weak-field systems may not be compatible with late-time acceleration driven by anything other than a constant term of the form f(0), which acts like a cosmological constant. For theories with f(R)=R^n we find that no known spherically symmetric vacuum solutions can be matched to an expanding FLRW background.

@article{Zhang2009,
abstract = {We have studied the X-ray nuclear activity of 187 nearby (distance < 15 Mpc) galaxies observed with Chandra/ACIS. We found that 86 of them have a point-like X-ray core, consistent with an accreting black hole (BH). We argue that the majority of them are nuclear BHs, rather than X-ray binaries. The fraction of galaxies with an X-ray detected nuclear BH is higher ($\sim$60 per cent) for ellipticals and early-type spirals (E to Sb), and lower ($\sim$30 per cent) for late-type spirals (Sc to Sm). There is no preferential association of X-ray cores with a large-scale bar; in fact, strongly barred galaxies appear to have slightly lower detection fraction and luminosity for their nuclear X-ray sources, compared with non-barred or weakly barred galaxies of similar Hubble types. The cumulative luminosity distribution of the nuclear sources in the 0.3-8 keV band is a power-law with slope $\sim$-0.5, from $\sim$2 x 10^{38} erg/s to $\sim$10^{42} erg/s. The Eddington ratio is lower for ellipticals (L_{X}/L_{Edd} $\sim$ 10^{-8}) and higher for late-type spirals (up to L_{X}/L_{Edd} $\sim$ 10^{-4}), but in all cases, the accretion rate is low enough to be in the radiatively-inefficient regime. The intrinsic NH is generally low, especially for the less luminous sources: there appear to be no Type-2 nuclear BHs at luminosities <$\sim$ 10^{39} erg/s. The lack of a dusty torus or of other sources of intrinsic absorption (e.g., an optically-thick disk wind) may be directly related to the lack of a standard accretion disk around those faint nuclear BHs. The fraction of obscured sources increases with the nuclear BH luminosity: 2/3 of the sources with L_{X} > 10^{40} erg/s have a fitted NH > 10^{22} cm^{-2}. This is contrary to the declining trend of the obscured fraction with increasing luminosities, observed in more luminous AGN and quasars.},

abstract = {The low-energy limit of string theory contains an anomaly-canceling correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, which defines an effective theory: Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity. The CS correction consists of the product of a scalar field with the Pontryagin density, where the former can be treated as a background field (non-dynamical formulation) or as an evolving field (dynamical formulation). Many solutions of general relativity persist in the modified theory; a notable exception is the Kerr metric, which has sparked a search for rotating black hole solutions. Here, for the first time, we find a solution describing a rotating black hole within the dynamical framework, and in the small-coupling/slow-rotation limit. The solution is axisymmetric and stationary, constituting a deformation of the Kerr metric with dipole scalar "hair," whose effect on geodesic motion is to weaken the frame-dragging effect and shift the location of the inner-most stable circular orbit outwards (inwards) relative to Kerr for co-rotating (counter-rotating) geodesics. We further show that the correction to the metric scales inversely with the fourth power of the radial distance to the black hole, suggesting it will escape any meaningful bounds from weak-field experiments. For example, using binary pulsar data we can only place an initial bound on the magnitude of the dynamical coupling constant of $\xi^{1/4} \lesssim 10^{4} {\textrm{km}}$. More stringent bounds will require observations of inherently strong-field phenomena.},

Under the stringent constraints imposed on the models by Solar System tests and galaxy-formation criteria, we show that the relative difference between the models' linear evolution of the lensing potential will be extremely hard to detect even with future space-based experiments such as {\it Euclid}, with a maximum value of approximately 4% for small scales.

abstract = {Inspiraling supermassive black hole binary systems with high orbital eccentricity are important sources for space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Eccentricity adds orbital harmonics to the Fourier-transform of the GW signal and relativistic pericenter precession leads to a three-way splitting of each harmonic peak. We study the parameter estimation accuracy for such waveforms with different initial eccentricity using the Fisher matrix method and a Monte Carlo sampling of the initial binary orientation. The eccentricity improves the parameter estimation by breaking degeneracies between different parameters. In particular, we find that the source localization precision improves significantly for higher mass binaries due to eccentricity. The typical sky position errors are $\sim1 $deg for a nonspinning, $10^7\,M_{\odot}$ equal mass binary at redshift $z=1$, if the initial eccentricity one year before merger is $e_0\sim 0.6$. Pericenter precession does not affect the source localization accuracy significantly, but it does further improve the mass and eccentricity estimation accuracy systematically by a factor of 3--10 for masses between $10^6$ and $10^7\,M_{\odot}$ for $e_0 \sim 0.3$.},

abstract = {The population of stellar-mass, compact object binaries that merge with non-negligible eccentricity may be large enough to motivate searches with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Such events could be exceptional laboratories to test General Relativity in the dynamical, strong-field regime, as a larger fraction of the energy is emitted at high-velocities, compared to quasi-circular inspirals. A serious obstacle here, however, is the challenge of computing theoretical waveforms for eccentric systems with the requisite accuracy for use in a matched-filter search. The corresponding waveforms are more a sequence of concentrated bursts of energy emitted near periapse than a continuous waveform. Based on this, an alternative approach, stacking excess power over the set of time-frequency tiles coincident with the bursts, was recently suggested as a more practical (though sub-optimal) detection strategy. The leading-order "observable'' that would be inferred from such a detection would be a sequence of discrete numbers characterizing the position and size of each time-frequency tile. In General Relativity, this (possibly large) sequence of numbers is uniquely determined by the small set of parameters describing the binary at formation. In this work, following the spirit of the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework developed for quasi-circular inspiral, we propose a simple, parameterized deformation of the baseline general relativistic burst algorithm for eccentric inspiral events that would allow for model-independent tests of Einstein's theory in this high-velocity, strong-field regime.},

abstract = {According to the no-hair theorem, all astrophysical black holes are fully described by their masses and spins. This theorem can be tested observationally by measuring (at least) three different multipole moments of the spacetimes of black holes. In this paper, we analyze images of black holes within a framework that allows us to calculate observables in the electromagnetic spectrum as a function of the mass, spin, and, independently, the quadrupole moment of a black hole. We show that a deviation of the quadrupole moment from the expected Kerr value leads to images of black holes that are either prolate or oblate depending on the sign and magnitude of the deviation. In addition, there is a ring-like structure around the black-hole shadow with a diameter of about 10 black-hole masses that is substantially brighter than the image of the underlying accretion flow and that is independent of the astrophysical details of accretion flow models. We show that the shape of this ring depends directly on the mass, spin, and quadrupole moment of the black hole and can be used for an independent measurement of all three parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that this ring is highly circular for a Kerr black hole with a spin a<0.9M, independent of the observer's inclination, but becomes elliptical and asymmetric if the no-hair theorem is violated. Near-future very-long baseline interferometric observations of Sgr A* will image this ring and may allow for an observational test of the no-hair theorem.},

For dark matter halos, we show that the semi-analytic thin shell condition, with a suitably-defined environment, provides a good approximation to describe the mass and environmental dependence of the screening of the fifth force in halos. Due to stronger gravity, there are far more massive halos and large voids in f(R) models compared with the \Lambda CDM model. The numbers of voids with an effective radius of 15Mpc/h are twice and four times as many as those in \Lambda CDM for f(R) models with |f_{R0}|=1e-5 and 1e-4 respectively. This provides a new means to test the models using the upcoming observational data. We also find that halos inside voids are all unscreened in our simulations, which are ideal objects for the gravity test.},

abstract = {Accurate parameter estimation of gravitational waves from coalescing compact binary sources is a key requirement for gravitational-wave astronomy. Evaluating the posterior probability density function of the binary's parameters (component masses, sky location, distance, etc.) requires computing millions of waveforms. The computational expense of parameter estimation is dominated by waveform generation and scales linearly with the waveform computational cost. Previous work showed that gravitational waveforms from non-spinning compact binary sources are amenable to a truncated singular value decomposition, which allows them to be reconstructed via interpolation at fixed computational cost. However, the accuracy requirement for parameter estimation is typically higher than for searches, so it is crucial to ascertain that interpolation does not lead to significant errors. Here we provide a proof of principle to show that interpolated waveforms can be used to recover posterior probability density functions with negligible loss in accuracy with respect to non-interpolated waveforms. This technique has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of parameter estimation.},

abstract = {We present the final nine-year maps and basic results from the WMAP mission. We provide new nine-year full sky temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate CMB anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. The WMAP mission has resulted in a highly constrained LCDM cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When WMAP data are combined with finer scale CMB, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Hubble constant measurements, we find that Big Bang nucleosynthesis is well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard number of neutrino species (3.26+/-0.35). The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is 13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc. Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n_s = 0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega_k = -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the standard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB predictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness-of-fit, the inflationary flat LCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology.},

abstract = {We describe a new space gravitational wave observatory design called LAGRANGE that maintains all important LISA science at about half the cost and with reduced technical risk. It consists of three drag-free spacecraft in the most stable geocentric formation, the Earth-Moon L3, L4, and L5 Lagrange points. Fixed antennas allow continuous contact with the Earth, solving the problem of communications bandwidth and latency. A 70 mm diameter AuPt sphere with a 35 mm gap to its enclosure serves as a single inertial reference per spacecraft, which is operated in "true" drag-free mode (no test mass forcing). This is the core of the Modular Gravitational Reference Sensor whose other advantages are: a simple caging design based on the DISCOS 1972 drag-free mission, an all optical read-out with pm fine and nm coarse sensors, and the extensive technology heritage from the Honeywell gyroscopes, and the DISCOS and Gravity Probe B drag-free sensors. An Interferometric Measurement System, designed with reflective optics and a highly stabilized frequency standard, performs the inter-test mass ranging and requires a single optical bench with one laser per spacecraft. Two 20 cm diameter telescopes per spacecraft, each with in-field pointing, incorporate novel technology developed for advanced optical systems by Lockheed Martin, who also designed the spacecraft based on a multi-flight proven bus structure. Additional technological advancements include the drag-free propulsion, thermal control, charge management systems, and materials. LAGRANGE sub-systems are designed to be scalable and modular, making them interchangeable with those of LISA or other gravitational science missions. We plan to space qualify critical technologies on small and nano satellite flights, with the first launch (UV-LED Sat) in 2013.},

Thus, noncommutative geometry provides a geometric interpretation of particle physics coupled to curvature. In this letter we use observations of pulsar timings, assuming that no deviation from General Relativity has been observed, to constrain the gravitational sector of this theory. Thus, we directly constrain noncommutative geometry, a potential grand unified theory of physics, via astrophysical observations.

abstract = {Millimeter wave Very Long Baseline Interferometry (mm-VLBI) provides access to the emission region surrounding Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, on sub-horizon scales. Recently, a closure phase of 0+-40 degrees was reported on a triangle of Earth-sized baselines (SMT-CARMA-JCMT) representing a new constraint upon the structure and orientation of the emission region, independent from those provided by the previously measured 1.3mm-VLBI visibility amplitudes alone. Here, we compare this to the closure phases associated with a class of physically motivated, radiatively inefficient accretion flow models, and present predictions for future mm-VLBI experiments with the developing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). We find that the accretion flow models are capable of producing a wide variety of closure phases on the SMT-CARMA-JCMT triangle, and thus not all models are consistent with the recent observations. However, those models that reproduce the 1.3mm-VLBI visibility amplitudes overwhelmingly have SMT-CARMA-JCMT closure phases between +-30 degrees, and are therefore broadly consistent with all current mm-VLBI observations. Improving station sensitivity by factors of a few, achievable by increases in bandwidth and phasing together multiple antennas at individual sites, should result in physically relevant additional constraints upon the model parameters and eliminate the current 180 degree ambiguity on the source orientation. When additional stations are included, closure phases of order 45--90 degrees are typical. In all cases the EHT will be able to measure these with sufficient precision to produce dramatic improvements in the constraints upon the spin of Sgr A*.},

The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional LCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their LCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r<0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038); the summed mass of neutrinos is <0.44 eV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to be 3.84+/-0.40 when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on Neff and the primordial helium abundance agrees with the prediction of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent PLANCK measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

abstract = {We report results from the BICEP2 experiment, a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarimeter specifically designed to search for the signal of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum around l=80. The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition edge sensor (TES) 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of approx. 300 uk.sqrt(s). BICEP2 observed from the South Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with an effective area of 380 square degrees was observed to a depth of 87 nK-degrees in Stokes Q and U. In this paper we describe the observations, data reduction, maps, simulations and results. We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-LCDM expectation in the range 30<l<150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of $>5\sigma$. Through jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the observed excess. We also estimate potential foreground signals and find that available models predict these to be considerably smaller than the observed signal. These foreground models possess no significant cross-correlation with our maps. Additionally, cross-correlating BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is confirmed with $3\sigma$ significance and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the CMB, disfavoring synchrotron or dust at $2.3\sigma$ and $2.2\sigma$, respectively. The observed B-mode power spectrum is well-fit by a lensed-LCDM + tensor theoretical model with tensor/scalar ratio $r=0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, with r=0 disfavored at $7.0\sigma$. Subtracting the best available estimate for foreground dust modifies the likelihood slightly so that r=0 is disfavored at $5.9\sigma$.},

abstract = {In order to attain the requisite sensitivity for LISA, laser frequency noise must be suppressed below the secondary noises such as the optical path noise, acceleration noise etc. In a previous paper (Dhurandhar et al., Class. Quantum Grav., 27, 135013, 2010), we have found a large family of second generation analytic solutions of time delay interferometry with one arm dysfunctional and also estimated the laser noise due to residual time-delay semi-analytically from orbit perturbations due to Earth. Since other planets and solar-system bodies also perturb the orbits of LISA spacecraft and affect the time delay interferometry (TDI), we simulate the time delay numerically in this paper for all solutions with n \leq 3. To conform to the actual LISA planning, we have worked out a set of 3-year optimized mission orbits of LISA spacecraft starting at June 21, 2021 using CGC2.7 ephemeris framework. We then use this numerical solution to calculate the residual optical path differences in the second generation solutions of our previous paper, and compare with the semi-analytic error estimate. The accuracy of this calculation is better than 1 cm (or 30 ps). The maximum path length difference, for all configuration calculated, is below 1 m (3 ns). This is well below the limit under which the laser frequency noise is required to be suppressed.},

abstract = {This is a summary of the methods we used to analyse the first IPTA Mock Data Challenge (MDC), and the obtained results. We have used a Bayesian analysis in the time domain, accelerated using the recently developed ABC-method which consists of a form of lossy linear data compression. The TOAs were first processed with Tempo2, where the design matrix was extracted for use in a subsequent Bayesian analysis. We used different noise models to analyse the datasets: no red noise, red noise the same for all pulsars, and individual red noise per pulsar. We sampled from the likelihood with four different samplers: "emcee", "t-walk", "Metropolis-Hastings", and "pyMultiNest". All but emcee agreed on the final result, with emcee failing due to artefacts of the high-dimensionality of the problem. An interesting issue we ran into was that the prior of all the 36 (red) noise amplitudes strongly affects the results. A flat prior in the noise amplitude biases the inferred GWB amplitude, whereas a flat prior in log-amplitude seems to work well. This issue is only apparent when using a noise model with individually modelled red noise for all pulsars. Our results for the blind challenges are in good agreement with the injected values. For the GWB amplitudes we found h_c = 1.03 +/- 0.11 [10^{-14}], h_c = 5.70 +/- 0.35 [10^{-14}], and h_c = 6.91 +/- 1.72 [10^{-15}], and for the GWB spectral index we found gamma = 4.28 +/- 0.20, gamma = 4.35 +/- 0.09, and gamma = 3.75 +/- 0.40. We note that for closed challenge 3 there was quite some covariance between the signal and the red noise: if we constrain the GWB spectral index to the usual choice of gamma = 13/3, we obtain the estimates: h_c = 10.0 +/- 0.64 [10^{-15}], h_c = 56.3 +/- 2.42 [10^{-15}], and h_c = 4.83 +/- 0.50 [10^{-15}], with one-sided 2 sigma upper-limits of: h_c <= 10.98 [10^{-15}], h_c <= 60.29 [10^{-15}], and h_c <= 5.65 [10^{-15}].},

abstract = {Understanding the predictions of general relativity for the dynamical interactions of two black holes has been a long-standing unsolved problem in theoretical physics. Black-hole mergers are monumental astrophysical events, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the form of gravitational radiation, and are key sources for both ground- and space-based gravitational wave detectors. The black-hole merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational waveforms can only be calculated through numerical simulations of Einstein's equations of general relativity. For many years, numerical relativists attempting to model these mergers encountered a host of problems, causing their codes to crash after just a fraction of a binary orbit could be simulated. Recently, however, a series of dramatic advances in numerical relativity has, for the first time, allowed stable, robust black hole merger simulations. We chronicle this remarkable progress in the rapidly maturing field of numerical relativity, and the new understanding of black-hole binary dynamics that is emerging. We also discuss important applications of these fundamental physics results to astrophysics, to gravitational-wave astronomy, and in other areas.},

Recent developments in the physics entering the modeling of these objects have led to significant improvements in the theory and to a better understanding of these objects' mechanical and thermal properties. This theory can now be confronted with observations directly in various observational diagrams (color-color, color-magnitude, mass-magnitude, mass-spectral type), a stringent and unavoidable constraint that became possible only recently with the generation of synthetic spectra. In this paper we present the current state-of-the-art general theory of low-mass stars and sub stellar objects, from one solar mass to one Jupiter mass, regarding primarily their interior structure and evolution. This review is a natural complement to the previous review by Allard et al (1997) on the atmosphere of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Special attention is devoted to the comparison of the theory with various available observations. The contribution of low-mass stellar and sub stellar objects to the Galactic mass budget is also analyzed.},

abstract = {The rapid advance of gravitational wave (GW) detector facilities makes it very important to estimate the event rates of possible detection candidates. We consider an additional possibility of GW bursts produced during parabolic encounters (PEs) of stellar-mass compact objects in globular clusters (GCs). We estimate the rate of successful detections for specific detectors: the initial Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (InLIGO), the French-Italian gravitational wave antenna VIRGO, the near-future Advanced-LIGO (AdLIGO), the space-based Laser Interferometric Space Antenna ( LISA ), and the Next Generation LISA ( NGLISA ). Simple GC models are constructed to account for the compact object mass function, mass segregation, number density distribution, and velocity distribution. We both calculate encounters classically and account for general relativistic corrections by extrapolating the results for infinite mass ratios. We also include the cosmological redshift of waveforms and event rates. We find that typical PEs with masses m 1 = m 2 = 40 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} are detectable with matched filtering over a signal-to-noise ratio S/N = 5 within a distance d L $\sim$ 200 Mpc for InLIGO and VIRGO, z = 1 for AdLIGO, 0.4 Mpc for LISA , and 1 Gpc for NGLISA . We estimate single data stream detection rates of 5.5 × 10 -5 yr -1 for InLIGO, 7.2 × 10 -5 yr -1 for VIRGO, 0.063 yr -1 for AdLIGO, 2.9 × 10 -6 yr -1 for LISA , and 1.0 yr -1 for NGLISA , for reasonably conservative assumptions. These estimates are subject to uncertainties in the GC parameters, most importantly the total number and mass distribution of BHs in the cluster core. In reasonably optimistic cases, we get ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 1 detection for AdLIGO per year. We expect that a coincident analysis using multiple detectors and accounting for GW recoil capture significantly increases the detection rates. The regular detection of GWs during PEs would provide a unique observational probe for constraining the stellar BH mass function of dense clusters.},

Core galaxies, typically with M_bh > 2x10^8 M_Sun and thought to be formed in dry merger events, are shown to be well described by a linear relation for which the median black hole mass is 0.36% - roughly double the old value of constancy. Of greater significance is that M_bh $\sim$ (M_sph)^2 among the (non-pseudobulge) lower-mass systems: specifically, log[M_bh/M_Sun] = (1.92+/-0.38)log[M_sph/7x10^{10}M_Sun] + (8.38+/-0.17). `Classical' spheroids hosting a 10^6 M_Sun black hole will have M_bh/M_sph $\sim$ 0.025%.

abstract = {One of the popular modifications to the theory of general relativity is non-dynamical Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, in which the metric is coupled to an externally prescribed scalar field. Setting accurate constraints to the parameters of the theory is important owing to their implications for the scalar field and/or the underlying fundamental theory. The current best constraints rely on measurements of the periastron precession rate in the double-binary-pulsar system and place a very tight bound on the characteristic CS lengthscale k_cs^{-1} <$\sim$ 3*10^{-9} km. This paper considers several effects that were not accounted for when deriving this bound and lead to a substantial suppression of the predicted rate of periastron precession. It is shown, in particular, that the point mass approximation for extended test bodies does not apply in this case. The constraint to the characteristic CS lengthscale is revised to k_cs^{-1} <$\sim$ 0.4 km, eight orders of magnitude weaker than what was previously found.},

abstract = {Resonant relaxation (RR) is a rapid relaxation process that operates in the nearly-Keplerian potential near a massive black hole (MBH). RR dominates the dynamics of compact remnants that inspiral into a MBH and emit gravitational waves (extreme mass ratio inspiral events, EMRIs). RR can either increase the EMRI rate, or strongly suppress it, depending on its still poorly-determined efficiency. We use small-scale Newtonian N-body simulations to measure the RR efficiency and to explore its possible dependence on the stellar number density profile around the MBH, and the mass-ratio between the MBH and a star (a single-mass stellar population is assumed). We develop an efficient and robust procedure for detecting and measuring RR in N-body simulations. We present a suite of simulations with a range of stellar density profiles and mass-ratios, and measure the mean RR efficiency in the near-Keplerian limit. We do not find a statistically significant dependence on the density profile or the mass-ratio. Our numerical determination of the RR efficiency in the Newtonian, single-mass population approximations, suggests that RR will likely enhance the EMRI rate by a factor of a few over the rates predicted assuming only slow stochastic two-body relaxation.},

@article{Baumgardt2004,
abstract = {In this paper we report results of collisional N-body simulations of the dynamical evolution of equal-mass star clusters containing a massive central black hole. Each cluster is composed of between 5,000 to 180,000 stars together with a central black hole which contains between 0.2% to 10% of the total cluster mass. We find that for large enough black hole masses, the central density follows a power-law distribution with slope \rho \sim r^{-1.75} inside the radius of influence of the black hole, in agreement with predictions from earlier Fokker Planck and Monte Carlo models. The tidal disruption rate of stars is within a factor of two of that derived in previous studies. It seems impossible to grow an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) from a M \le 100 Msun progenitor in a globular cluster by the tidal disruption of stars, although M = 10^3 Msun IMBHs can double their mass within a Hubble time in dense globular clusters. The same is true for the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. Black holes in star clusters will feed mainly on stars tightly bound to them and the re-population of these stars causes the clusters to expand, reversing core-collapse without the need for dynamically active binaries. Close encounters of stars in the central cusp also lead to an increased mass loss rate in the form of high-velocity stars escaping from the cluster. A companion paper will extend these results to the multi-mass case.},

@article{Miralda-Escude2012,
abstract = {We propose that the cloud of gas moving on a highly eccentric orbit around the central black hole in our Galaxy, reported by Gillessen et al., is produced by a wind from photoevaporating debris orbiting around a star with a small circumstellar disk. The disk is tidally truncated to less than 1 AU at the peribothron passage, and a cloud like the observed one is recreated by the wind at every orbit. The star-disk system, which may have been producing the cloud for hundreds of orbits in the past, is proposed to have formed when the star flew by a stellar black hole and was tidally disrupted and deflected to its present orbit. Encounters of low-mass stars with stellar black holes are likely to occur at the location of this cloud, because of the high density of stellar black holes expected to have migrated to the Galactic center by mass segregation. The rate of these encounters at a small enough impact parameter to disrupt the star may reasonably be $\sim$ 10^{-6} per year. The flyby should have spun up the star and pulled out a substantial fraction of its mass as tidal debris, part of which fell back onto the star and created a small disk. Since then, the disk may have expanded by absorbing angular momentum from the star up to the tidal truncation radius. Thereafter, the strong tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron may create gas streams moving out to larger radius that can photoevaporate and generate the wind that produces the cloud at every orbit. The model predicts that when the cloud is disrupted at the next peribothron passage in 2013, a smaller unresolved cloud will follow the star on the same orbit that will gradually grow. An increased infrared luminosity from the disk may also become detectable during the peribothron passage.},

We find that different (second-order) dynamical equations arise depending on whether torsion is set to zero i) a priori or ii) a posteriori, i.e., before or after considering variations of the action. Considering a generic family of Ricci-squared theories, we show that in both cases the connection can be decomposed as the sum of a Levi-Civita connection and terms depending on a vector field. However, while in case i) this vector field is related to the symmetric part of the connection, in ii) it comes from the torsion part and, therefore, it vanishes once torsion is completely removed. Moreover, the vanishing of this torsion-related vector field immediately implies the vanishing of the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor, which therefore plays no role in the dynamics. Related to this, we find that the Levi-Civita part of the connection is due to the existence of an invariant volume associated to an auxiliary metric $h_{\mu\nu}$, which is algebraically related with the physical metric $g_{\mu\nu}$.},

All these observables are independent of laser frequency fluctuations and have different couplings to gravitational waves and to the various LISA instrumental noises. Within the functional space of interferometric combinations LISA will be able to synthesize, we have identified a triplet of interferometric combinations that show optimally combined sensitivity. As an application of the method, we computed the sensitivity improvement for sinusoidal sources in the nominal, equal-arm LISA configuration. In the part of the Fourier band where the period of the wave is longer than the typical light travel-time across LISA, the sensitivity gain over a single Michelson interferometer is equal to $\sqrt{2}$. In the mid-band region, where the LISA Michelson combination has its best sensitivity, the improvement over the Michelson sensitivity is slightly better than $\sqrt{2}$, and the frequency band of best sensitivity is broadened. For frequencies greater than the reciprocal of the light travel-time, the sensitivity improvement is oscillatory and $\sim \sqrt{3}$, but can be greater than $\sqrt{3}$ near frequencies that are integer multiples of the inverse of the one-way light travel-time in the LISA arm.},

The formula derived for graviton bremsstrahlung is then used to estimate the gravitational radiation emitted during thermal collisions in the sun, and we find this to be a stronger source of gravitational radiation (though still very weak) than classical sources such as planetary motion. We also verify the conjecture of Dalitz that divergences in the Coulomb-scattering Born series may be summed to an innocuous phase factor, and we show how this result may be extended to processes involving arbitrary numbers of relativistic or nonrelativistic particles with arbitrary spin.},

abstract = {Chameleons are light scalar fields with remarkable properties. Through the interplay of self-interactions and coupling to matter, chameleon particles have a mass that depends on the ambient matter density. The manifestation of the fifth force mediated by chameleons therefore depends sensitively on their environment, which makes for a rich phenomenology. In this article, we review two recent results on chameleon phenomenology. The first result a pair of no-go theorems limiting the cosmological impact of chameleons and their generalizations: i) the range of the chameleon force at cosmological density today can be at most $\sim$Mpc; ii) the conformal factor relating Einstein- and Jordan-frame scale factors is essentially constant over the last Hubble time. These theorems imply that chameleons have negligible effect on the linear growth of structure, and cannot account for the observed cosmic acceleration except as some form of dark energy. The second result pertains to the quantum stability of chameleon theories. We show how requiring that quantum corrections be small, so as to allow reliable predictions of fifth forces, leads to an upper bound of m < 0.0073 (\rho/ 10 g cm^{-3})^{1/3} eV for gravitational strength coupling, whereas fifth force experiments place a lower bound of m>0.0042 eV. An improvement of less than a factor of two in the range of fifth force experiments could test all classical chameleon field theories whose quantum corrections are well-controlled and couple to matter with nearly gravitational strength regardless of the specific form of the chameleon potential.},

We make use of the analogy of $f(R)$ theories with scalar--tensor theories, which in contrast to General Relativity feature an additional scalar degree of freedom. Unlike General Relativity, where the leading order gravitational radiation is produced by quadrupole moments, the additional degree of freedom predicts gravitational radiation of all multipoles, in particular monopoles and dipoles, as this is the case for the most alternative gravity theories known today. An application to a hypothetical binary pulsar moving in a circular orbit yields the rough limit $a \lesssim 1.7\cdot10^{17}\,\mathrm{m}^2$ by constraining the dipole power to account at most for 1% of the quadrupole power as predicted by General Relativity.},

abstract = {This review is concerned with the gravitational self-force acting on a mass particle in orbit around a large black hole. Renewed interest in this old problem is driven by the prospects of detecting gravitational waves from strongly gravitating binaries with extreme mass ratios. We begin here with a summary of recent advances in the theory of gravitational self-interaction in curved spacetime, and proceed to survey some of the ideas and computational strategies devised for implementing this theory in the case of a particle orbiting a Kerr black hole. We review in detail two of these methods: (i) the standard mode-sum method, in which the metric perturbation is regularized mode-by-mode in a multipole decomposition, and (ii) m-mode regularization, whereby individual azimuthal modes of the metric perturbation are regularized in 2+1 dimensions. We discuss several practical issues that arise, including the choice of gauge, the numerical representation of the particle singularity, and how high-frequency contributions near the particle are dealt with in frequency-domain calculations. As an example of a full end-to-end implementation of the mode-sum method, we discuss the computation of the gravitational self-force for eccentric geodesic orbits in Schwarzschild, using a direct integration of the Lorenz-gauge perturbation equations in the time domain. With the computational framework now in place, researchers have recently turned to explore the physical consequences of the gravitational self-force; we will describe some preliminary results in this area. An appendix to this review presents, for the first time, a detailed derivation of the 'regularization parameters' necessary for implementing the mode-sum method in Kerr spacetime.},

@article{Doeleman2009,
abstract = {A long standing goal in astrophysics is to directly observe the immediate environment of a black hole with angular resolution comparable to the event horizon. Realizing this goal would open a new window on the study of General Relativity in the strong field regime, accretion and outflow processes at the edge of a black hole, the existence of an event horizon, and fundamental black hole physics (e.g., spin). Steady long-term progress on improving the capability of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at short wavelengths has now made it extremely likely that this goal will be achieved within the next decade. The most compelling evidence for this is the recent observation by 1.3mm VLBI of Schwarzschild radius scale structure in SgrA*, the compact source of radio, submm, NIR and xrays at the center of the Milky Way. SgrA* is thought to mark the position of a $\sim$4 million solar mass black hole, and because of its proximity and estimated mass presents the largest apparent event horizon size of any black hole candidate in the Universe. Over the next decade, existing and planned mm/submm facilities will be combined into a high sensitivity, high angular resolution "Event Horizon Telescope" that will bring us as close to the edge of black hole as we will come for decades. This white paper describes the science case for mm/submm VLBI observations of both SgrA* and M87 (a radio loud AGN of a much more luminous class that SgrA*). We emphasize that while there is development and procurement involved, the technical path forward is clear, and the recent successful observations have removed much of the risk that would normally be associated with such an ambitious project.},

abstract = {The motion of a point like object of mass M passing through the background potential of massive collisionless particles (m << M) suffers a steady deceleration named dynamic friction. In his classical work, Chandrasekhar assumed a Maxwellian velocity distribution in the halo and neglected the self gravity of the wake induced by the gravitational focusing of the mass M. In this paper, by relaxing the validity of the Maxwellian distribution due to the presence of long range forces, we derive an analytical formula for the dynamic friction in the context of the q-nonextensive kinetic theory. In the extensive limiting case (q = 1), the classical Gaussian Chandrasekhar result is recovered. As an application, the dynamic friction timescale for Globular Clusters spiraling to the galactic center is explicitly obtained. Our results suggest that the problem concerning the large timescale as derived by numerical N-body simulations or semi-analytical models can be understood as a departure from the standard extensive Maxwellian regime as measured by the Tsallis nonextensive q-parameter.},

abstract = {On February 13th 2012, the LARES satellite of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) was launched into orbit with the qualification flight of the new VEGA launcher of the European Space Agency (ESA). The payload was released very accurately in the nominal orbit. The name LARES means LAser RElativity Satellite and summarises the objective of the mission and some characteristics of the satellite. It is, in fact, a mission designed to test Einstein's General Relativity Theory (specifically 'frame dragging' and Lense-Thirring effect). The satellite is passive and covered with optical retroreflectors that send back laser pulses to the emitting ground station. This allows accurate positioning of the satellite, which is important for measuring the very small deviations from Galilei-Newton's laws. In 2008, ASI selected the prime industrial contractor for the LARES system with a heavy involvement of the universities in all phases of the programme, from the design to the construction and testing of the satellite and separation system. The data exploitation phase started immediately after the launch under a new contract between ASI and those universities. Tracking of the satellite is provided by the International Laser Ranging Service. Due to its particular design, LARES is the orbiting object with the highest known mean density in the solar system. In this paper, it is shown that this peculiarity makes it the best proof particle ever manufactured. Design aspects, mission objectives and preliminary data analysis will be also presented.},

abstract = {Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback provides the link between the central black hole and its host galaxy. We assume AGN feedback driven by radiation pressure on dust, which sweeps up the ambient dusty gas into an outflowing shell, and consider feedback-triggered star formation in the outflow. An upper limit to the characteristic size of galaxies may be defined by the critical radius beyond which radiation pressure on dust is no longer able to drive the shell. The corresponding enclosed mass may be compared with the host galaxy bulge mass. We show that the resulting relation between characteristic radius and mass, of the form $R \propto \sqrt M$, corresponds to the observed mass-radius relation of early-type galaxies. We suggest that such simple physical scalings may account for a number of observed galaxy scaling relations. In this picture, both the size and structural evolution of galaxies can be interpreted as a consequence of AGN feedback-driven star formation, mainly associated with the spheroidal component. The accreting black hole is responsible for triggering star formation in the host galaxy, while ultimately clearing the dusty gas out of the host, thus also contributing to the chemical evolution of galaxies. We discuss the importance of radiation pressure on dust in determining the galaxies large-scale properties, and consider the possibility of the central black hole directly shaping its host galaxy through AGN feedback.},

I review some ways in which astrophysical black holes can be used as natural laboratories for both "internal" and "external" tests of general relativity. The examples provided here (ringdown tests of the black hole "no-hair" theorem, bosonic superradiant instabilities in rotating black holes and gravitational-wave tests of massive scalar-tensor theories) are shamelessly biased towards recent research by myself and my collaborators. Hopefully this colloquial introduction aimed mainly at astrophysicists will convince skeptics (if there are any) that space-based detectors will be crucial to study fundamental physics through gravitational-wave observations.},

abstract = {Resonant relaxation (RR) of orbital angular momenta occurs near massive black holes (MBHs) where the potential is spherical and stellar orbits are nearly Keplerian and so do not precess significantly. The resulting coherent torques efficiently change the magnitude of the angular momenta and rotate the orbital inclination in all directions. As a result, many of the tightly bound stars very near the MBH are rapidly destroyed by falling into the MBH on low angular momentum orbits, while the orbits of the remaining stars are efficiently randomized. We solve numerically the Fokker-Planck equation in energy for the steady state distribution of a single-mass population with an RR sink term. We find that the steady state current of stars, which sustains the accelerated drainage close to the MBH, can be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 10 larger than that due to noncoherent two-body relaxation alone. RR mostly affects tightly bound stars, and so it increases only moderately the total tidal disruption rate, which is dominated by stars originating from less bound orbits farther away. We show that the event rate of gravitational wave (GW) emission from inspiraling stars, originating much closer to the MBH, is dominated by RR dynamics. The GW event rate depends on the uncertain efficiency of RR. The efficiency indicated by the few available simulations implies rates ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 10 times higher than those predicted by two-body relaxation, which would improve the prospects of detecting such events by future GW detectors, such as LISA . However, a higher, but still plausible, RR efficiency can lead to the drainage of all tightly bound stars and strong suppression of GW events from inspiraling stars. We apply our results to the Galactic MBH and show that the observed dynamical properties of stars there are consistent with RR.},

abstract = {The flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and accretion of a star can be used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant and undetected in the centres of distant galaxies. Previous candidate flares have had declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poor constraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, because the rising emission was not observed. Recently, two 'relativistic' candidate tidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity and synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from a relativistic jet. Here we report a luminous ultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at a redshift of 0.1696. The observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simple accreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decay of the light curve follow the predicted mass accretion rate and can be modelled to determine the time of disruption to an accuracy of two days. The black hole has a mass of about two million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radius of the star disrupted. On the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionized helium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was a helium-rich stellar core.},

abstract = {Black hole spin is a quantity of great interest to both physicists and astrophysicists. We review the current status of spin measurements in supermassive black holes (SMBH). To date, every robust SMBH spin measurement uses X-ray reflection spectroscopy, so we focus almost exclusively on this technique as applied to moderately-luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). After describing the foundations and uncertainties of the method, we summarize the current status of the field. At the time of writing, observations by XMM-Newton, Suzaku and NuSTAR have given robust spin constraints on 22 SMBHs. We find a significant number of rapidly-rotating SMBHs (with dimensionless spin parameters a>0.9) although, especially at the higher masses (M>4*10^7Msun), there are also some SMBHs with intermediate spin parameters. This may be giving us our first hint at a mass-dependent spin distribution which would, in turn, provide interesting constraints on models for SMBH growth. We also discuss the recent discovery of relativistic X-ray reverberation which we can use to "echo map" the innermost regions of the accretion disk. The ultimate development of these reverberation techniques, when applied to data from future high-throughput X-ray observatories such as LOFT, ATHENA+, and AXSIO, will permit the measurement of black hole spin by a characterization of strong-field Shapiro delays. We conclude with a brief discussion of other electromagnetic methods that have been attempted or are being developed to constrain SMBH spin.},

The first post-Newtonian approximation is valid to $10^{-6}$ and the second post-Newtonian is valid to $10^{-12}$ in the solar system. The scalar-tensor theory is widely discussed and used in tests of relativistic gravity, especially after the interests in inflation, cosmological constant and dark energy in cosmology. In the Lagrangian, intermediate-range gravity term has a similar form as cosmological term. Here we present the full second post-Newtonian approximation of the scalar-tensor theory including viable examples of intermediate-range gravity. We use Chandrasekhar's approach to derive the metric coefficients and the equation of the hydrodynamics governing a perfect fluid in the 2nd post-Newtonian approximation in scalar-tensor theory; all terms inclusive of $O(c^{-4})$ are retained consistently in the equation of motion.},

We find that compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model, MG models can not lead to a appreciable reduction of the $\chi^2_{min}$. The analysis of AIC and BIC shows that the simplest cosmological constant model($\Lambda$CDM) is still most preferred by the current data, and the DGP model is strongly disfavored. In addition, from the observational constraints, we also reconstruct the evolutions of the growth factor in these models. We find that the current available growth factor data are not enough to distinguish these MG models from the $\Lambda$CDM model.},

abstract = {The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) guarantees the detection of gravitational waves by monitoring a handful of known nearby galactic binary systems, the so-called ``verification binaries''. We consider the most updated information on the source parameters for the thirty more promising verification binaries. We investigate which of them are indeed guaranteed sources for LISA and estimate the accuracy of the additional information that can be extracted during the mission. Our analysis considers the two independent Michelson outputs that can be synthesised from the LISA constellation, and we model the LISA transfer function using the rigid adiabatic approximation. We carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulations to explore the dependency of our results on unknown or poorly constrained source parameters. We find that four sources -- RXJ0806.3+1527, V407 Vul, ES Cet and AM CVn -- are clearly detectable in one year of observation; RXJ0806.3+1527 should actually be observable in less than a week. For these sources LISA will also provide information on yet unknown parameters with an error between approximately 1 percent and 10 percent. Four additional binary systems -- HP Lib, 4U 1820-30, WZ Sge and KPD 1930+2752 -- might also be marginally detectable.},

abstract = {We study some possible observational signatures of $R^n$ gravity at Galactic scales and how these signatures could be used for constraining this type of $f(R)$ gravity. For that purpose, we performed two-body simulations in $R^n$ gravity potential and analyzed the obtained trajectories of S2-like stars around Galactic center, as well as resulting parameter space of $R^n$ gravity potential. Here, we discuss the constraints on the $R^n$ gravity which can be obtained from the observations of orbits of S2-like stars with the present and next generations of large telescopes. We make comparison between the theoretical results and observations. Our results show that the most probable value for the parameter $r_c$ in $R^n$ gravity potential in the case of S2-like stars is $\sim$100 AU, while the universal parameter $\beta$ is close to 0.01. Also, the $R^n$ gravity potential induces the precession of S2-like stars orbit in opposite direction with respect to General Relativity, therefore, such a behavior of orbits qualitatively is similar to a behavior of Newtonian orbits with a bulk distribution of matter (including a stellar cluster and dark matter distributions).},

abstract = {The high-frequency expansion of a vacuum gravitational field in powers of its small wavelength is continued. We go beyond the previously discussed linearization of the field equations to consider the lowest-order nonlinearities. These are shown to provide a natural, gauge-invariant, averaged stress tensor for the effective energy localized in the high-frequency gravitational waves. Under the assumption of the WKB form for the field, this stress tensor is found to have the same algebraic structure as that for an electromagnetic null field. A Poynting vector is used to investigate the flow of energy and momentum by gravitational waves, and it is seen that high-frequency waves propagate along null hypersurfaces and are not backscattered by the lowest-order nonlinearities. Expressions for the total energy and momentum carried by the field to flat null infinity are given in terms of coordinate-independent hypersurface integrals valid within regions of high field strength. The formalism is applied to the case of spherical gravitational waves where a news function is obtained and where the source is found to lose exactly the energy and momentum contained in the radiation field. Second-order terms in the metric are found to be finite and free of divergences of the (lnr)/r variety.},

abstract = {The mathematical simplicity of black holes, combined with their links to some of the most energetic events in the universe, means that black holes are key objects for fundamental physics and astrophysics. Until recently, it was generally believed that black holes in nature appear in two broad mass ranges: stellar-mass (roughly 3-20 solar masses), which are produced by the core collapse of massive stars, and supermassive (millions to billions of solar masses), which are found in the centers of galaxies and are produced by a still uncertain combination of processes. In the last few years, however, evidence has accumulated for an intermediate-mass class of black holes, with hundreds to thousands of solar masses. If such objects exist they have important implications for the dynamics of stellar clusters, the formation of supermassive black holes, and the production and detection of gravitational waves. We review the evidence for intermediate-mass black holes and discuss future observational and theoretical work that will help clarify numerous outstanding questions about these objects.},

abstract = {In many astrophysical problems, it is important to understand the behavior of functions that come from rotating (Kerr) black hole orbits. It can be particularly useful to work with the frequency domain representation of those functions, in order to bring out their harmonic dependence upon the fundamental orbital frequencies of Kerr black holes. Although, as has recently been shown by W. Schmidt, such a frequency domain representation must exist, the coupled nature of a black hole orbit's $r$ and $\theta$ motions makes it difficult to construct such a representation in practice. Combining Schmidt's description with a clever choice of timelike coordinate suggested by Y. Mino, we have developed a simple procedure that sidesteps this difficulty. One first Fourier expands all quantities using Mino's time coordinate $\lambda$. In particular, the observer's time $t$ is decomposed with $\lambda$. The frequency domain description is then built from the $\lambda$-Fourier expansion and the expansion of $t$. We have found this procedure to be quite simple to implement, and to be applicable to a wide class of functionals. We test the procedure using a simple test function, and then apply it in a particularly interesting case, the Weyl curvature scalar $\psi_4$ used in black hole perturbation theory.},

abstract = {Many classes of objects and events are thought to form in binary star systems after a phase in which a core and companion spiral to smaller separation inside a common envelope (CE).Such a phase can end with the merging of the two stars or with the ejection of the envelope to leave a surviving binary system.The outcome is usually predicted by calculating the separation to which the stars must spiral to eject the envelope, assuming that the ratio of the core--envelope binding energy to the change in orbital energy is equal to a constant efficiency factor $\alpha$. If either object would overfill its Roche lobe at this end-of-CE separation, then the stars are assumed to merge. It is unclear what critical radius should be compared to the end-of-CE Roche lobe for stars which have developed cores before the start of a CE phase. After improving the core radius formulae in the widely used BSE rapid evolution code, we compare the properties of populations in which the critical radius is chosen to be the pre-CE core radius or the post-CE stripped remnant radius. Our improvements to the core radius formulae and the uncertainty in the critical radius significantly affect the rates of merging in CE phases of most types. We find the types of systems for which these changes are most important.},

The expected amplitudes of relic gravitational waves are different in different frequency windows, and therefore the techniques and prospects of their detection are different. One section of the paper describes the present state of efforts in direct detection of relic gravitational waves. Another section is devoted to indirect detection via the anisotropy and polarisation measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). It is emphasized throughout the paper that the conclusions on the existence and expected amount of relic gravitational waves are based on a solid theoretical foundation and the best available cosmological observations.

@article{Hopkins2011,
abstract = {It is well-established observationally that the characteristic angular momentum axis on small scales around AGN, traced by radio jets and the putative torus, is not well-correlated with the large-scale angular momentum axis of the host galaxy. In this paper, we show that such misalignments arise naturally in high-resolution simulations in which we follow angular momentum transport and inflows from galaxy to sub-pc scales near AGN, triggered either during galaxy mergers or by instabilities in isolated disks. Sudden misalignments can sometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightly off-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smooth and trace only global gravitational instabilities. When several nested, self-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble in the potential of the outer modes. Resonant angular momentum exchange can flip or re-align the spin of an inner mode on a short timescale, even without the presence of massive clumps. We therefore do not expect that AGN and their host galaxies will be preferentially aligned, nor should the relative alignment be an indicator of the AGN fueling mechanism. We discuss implications of this conclusion for AGN feedback and BH spin evolution. The misalignments imply that even BHs accreting from a smooth large-scale disk at near-Eddington will not be spun up to maximal rotation, but to moderate values of angular momentum |a|$\sim$0.3-0.9. This corresponds to a narrow range in radiative efficiencies epsilon_r$\sim$0.1, and relatively inefficient jet formation at high Eddington ratio. Even lower spins are possible if there is further, un-resolved clumpiness and misalignment and higher spins occur if the accretion is slower, from material that is not self-gravitating.},

abstract = {We study the long term dynamical evolution of stellar mass black holes (BHs) at the Galactic center (GC) and put constraints on their number and central mass distribution. Models of the GC are considered that have not yet achieved a steady state under the influence of random gravitational encounters. Contrary to some recent claims that mass-segregation can rapidly rebuild a density cusp in the stars, we find that time scales associated with cusp regrowth are longer than the Hubble time. These results cast doubts on standard models that postulate high densities of BHs near the GC and motivate studies that start from initial conditions which correspond to well-defined physical models. For the first time, we consider the distribution of BHs in a dissipationless formation model for the Milky Way nuclear cluster (NC), in which massive stellar clusters merge in the GC to form a nucleus. We simulate the successive inspiral of massive clusters containing an inner dense cluster of BHs. The pre-existing mass segregation is not completely erased as the clusters are disrupted by the massive black hole tidal field. As a result, after 12 inspiral events a NC forms in which the BHs have higher central densities than the stars. After evolving the model for 5-10 Gyr, the BHs do form a steep central cusp, while the stellar distribution maintains properties that resemble those of the Milky Way NC. Finally, we investigate the effect of BH perturbations on the motion of the GC S-stars, as a means of constraining the number of the perturbers. We find that reproducing the S-star orbital distribution requires >$\sim$1000 BHs within 0.1 pc of Sgr A*. A disspationless formation scenario for the Milky Way NC is consistent with this lower limit and therefore could reconcile the need for high central densities of BHs (to explain the orbits of the S-stars), with the missing-cusp problem of the GC giant star population.},

A dipole contribution only appears at higher post-Newtonian order. We use these findings to constrain the low-energy action of Ho\v{r}ava gravity by comparing them with the radiation damping observed for binary pulsars. Even if this comparison is not completely appropriate - since compact objects cannot be described within the post-Newtonian approximation - it represents an order of magnitude estimate. In the limit where the post-Newtonian metric coincides with that of General Relativity, our energy-loss formula provides the strongest constraints for Ho\v{r}ava gravity at low-energies.},

We show, for the first time, that these constraints remain valid upon removal from our sample of the most extreme transient sources or of the entire set of bursting sources; our constraints also apply even if deconfined quark matter exists in the neutron star core. Our results significantly constrain the dense matter EOS and are, furthermore, consistent with constraints from both heavy-ion collisions and theoretical studies of neutron matter.

abstract = {The spin angular momentum S of a supermassive black hole (SBH) precesses due to torques from orbiting stars, and the stellar orbits precess due to dragging of inertial frames by the spinning hole. We solve the coupled post-Newtonian equations describing the joint evolution of S and the stellar angular momenta Lj, j = 1...N in spherical, rotating nuclear star clusters. In the absence of gravitational interactions between the stars, two evolutionary modes are found: (1) nearly uniform precession of S about the total angular momentum vector of the system; (2) damped precession, leading, in less than one precessional period, to alignment of S with the angular momentum of the rotating cluster. Beyond a certain distance from the SBH, the time scale for angular momentum changes due to gravitational encounters between the stars is shorter than spin-orbit precession times. We present a model, based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation, for the stochastic evolution of star clusters due to gravitational encounters and use it to evaluate the evolution of S in nuclei where changes in the Lj are due to frame dragging close to the SBH and to encounters farther out. Long-term evolution in this case is well described as uniform precession of the SBH about the cluster's rotational axis, with an increasingly important stochastic contribution when SBH masses are small. Spin precessional periods are predicted to be strongly dependent on nuclear properties, but typical values are 10-100 Myr for low-mass SBHs in dense nuclei, 100 Myr - 10 Gyr for intermediate mass SBHs, and > 10 Gyr for the most massive SBHs. We compare the evolution of SBH spins in stellar nuclei to the case of torquing by an inclined, gaseous accretion disk.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral, plunge and merger of a black hole binary carry linear momentum. This results in an astrophysically important recoil to the final merged black hole, a ``kick'' that can eject it from the nucleus of a galaxy. In a previous paper we showed that the puzzling partial cancellation of an early kick by a late antikick, and the dependence of the cancellation on black hole spin, can be understood from the phenomenology of the linear momentum waveforms. Here we connect that phenomenology to its underlying cause, the spin-dependence of the inspiral trajectories. This insight suggests that the details of plunge can be understood more broadly with a focus on inspiral trajectories.},

abstract = {The very bright red star HV2112 in the Small Magellanic Cloud could be a massive Thorne-Zytkow Object, a supergiant-like star with a degenerate neutron core. With its luminosity of over $10^5\,\rm L_\odot$, it could also be a super asymptotic giant branch star, a star with an oxygen/neon core supported by electron degeneracy and undergoing thermal pulses with third dredge up. Both TZOs and SAGB stars are expected to be rare. Abundances of heavy elements in HV2112's atmosphere, as observed to date, do not allow us to distinguish between the two possibilities based on the latest models. Molybdenum and rubidium can be enhanced by both the irp-process in a TZO or by the s-process in SAGB stars. Lithium can be generated by hot bottom burning at the base of the convective envelope in either. HV2112's enhanced calcium could thus be the key determinant. A SAGB star is not able to synthesise its own calcium but it may be possible to produce this in the final stages of the process that forms a TZO, when the degenerate electron core of a giant star is tidally disrupted by a neutron star. Hence our calculations indicate that HV2112 is most likely a genuine TZO.},

@article{Marleau2012,
abstract = {We present the results of a study of a statistically significant sample of galaxies which clearly demonstrate that supermassive black holes are generically present in all morphological types. Our analysis is based on the quantitative morphological classification of 1.12 million galaxies in the SDSS DR7 and on the detection of black hole activity via two different methods, the first one based on their X-ray/radio emission and the second one based on their mid-infrared colors. The results of the first analysis confirm the correlation between black hole and total stellar mass for 8 galaxies and includes one galaxy classified as bulgeless. The results of our second analysis, consisting of 15,991 galaxies, show that galaxies hosting a supermassive black hole follow the same morphological distribution as the general population of galaxies in the same redshift range. In particular, the fraction of bulgeless galaxies, 1,450 galaxies or 9 percent, is found to be the same as in the general population. We also present the correlation between black hole and total stellar mass for 6,247 of these galaxies. Importantly, whereas previous studies were limited to primarily bulge-dominated systems, our study confirms this relationship to all morphological types, in particular, to 530 bulgeless galaxies. Our results indicate that the true correlation that exists for supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is between the black hole mass and the total stellar mass of the galaxy and hence, we conclude that the previous assumption that the black hole mass is correlated with the bulge mass is only approximately correct.},

abstract = {The Galactic massive black hole (MBH), with a mass of Mbh=3.6\times10^6 Solar masses, is the closest known MBH, at a distance of only 8 kpc. The proximity of this MBH makes it possible to observe gravitational waves from stars with periapse in the observational frequency window of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). This is possible even if the orbit of the star is very eccentric, so that the orbital frequency is many orders of magnitude below the LISA frequency window, as suggested by Rubbo et al. (2006). Here we give an analytical estimate of the detection rate of such gravitational wave bursts. The burst rate is critically sensitive to the inner cut-off of the stellar density profile. Our model accounts for mass-segregation and for the physics determining the inner radius of the cusp, such as stellar collisions, energy dissipation by gravitational wave emission, and consequences of the finite number of stars. We find that stellar black holes have a burst rate of the order of 1 per year, while the rate is of order 0.1 per year for main sequence stars and white dwarfs. These analytical estimates are supported by a series of Monte Carlo samplings of the expected distribution of stars around the Galactic MBH, which yield the full probability distribution for the rates. We estimate that no burst will be observable from the Virgo cluster.},

@article{Guillochon2014,
abstract = {The discovery of the gas cloud G2 on a near-radial orbit about Sgr A* has prompted much speculation on its origin. In this Letter, we propose that G2 formed out the debris stream produced by the removal of mass from the outer envelope of a nearby giant star. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the returning tidal debris stream with cooling, and find that the stream condenses into clumps that fall to Sgr A* approximately once per decade. We propose that one of these clumps is the observed G2 cloud, with the rest of the stream being detectable at lower Br-$\gamma$ emissivity along a trajectory that would trace from G2 to the star that was partially disrupted. By simultaneously fitting the orbits of S2, G2, and $\sim$2,000 candidate stars, and by fixing the orbital plane of each candidate star to G2 (as is expected for a tidal disruption), we find that the late-type star S1-34 has an orbit that is compatible with the notion that it was tidally disrupted to produce G2. If S1-34 is indeed the star that was disrupted, it last encountered Sgr A* in the late 18th century, and will likely be disrupted again in several hundred years. However, while S1-34's orbit is compatible with the giant disruption scenario given its measured position and proper motion, its radial velocity is currently unknown. If S1-34's radial velocity is measured to be compatible with a disruptive orbit, it would strongly suggest that a tidal disruption of S1-34 produced G2.},

abstract = {We present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with 223 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the InterPlanetary Network (IPN) in 2005-2010 during LIGO's fifth and sixth science runs and Virgo's first, second and third science runs. The IPN satellites provide accurate times of the bursts and sky localizations that vary significantly from degree scale to hundreds of square degrees. We search for both a well-modeled binary coalescence signal, the favored progenitor model for short GRBs, and for generic, unmodeled gravitational wave bursts. Both searches use the event time and sky localization to improve the gravitational-wave search sensitivity as compared to corresponding all-time, all-sky searches. We find no evidence of a gravitational-wave signal associated with any of the IPN GRBs in the sample, nor do we find evidence for a population of weak gravitational-wave signals associated with the GRBs. For all IPN-detected GRBs, for which a sufficient duration of quality gravitational-wave data is available, we place lower bounds on the distance to the source in accordance with an optimistic assumption of gravitational-wave emission energy of $10^{-2}M_{\odot}c^2$ at 150 Hz, and find a median of 13 Mpc. For the 27 short-hard GRBs we place 90% confidence exclusion distances to two source models: a binary neutron star coalescence, with a median distance of 12Mpc, or the coalescence of a neutron star and black hole, with a median distance of 22 Mpc. Finally, we combine this search with previously published results to provide a population statement for GRB searches in first-generation LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors, and a resulting examination of prospects for the advanced gravitational-wave detectors.},

abstract = {Massive black holes appear to be present in the nuclei of almost all galaxies, but their genesis and evolution are not well understood. As astrophysical black holes are completely characterized by their masses and spins, the observed joint distribution of these quantities contains important clues to their history. We examine the coevolution of mass and spin in binary merger growth scenarios. We find that holes are typically spun down by mergers. Rapid rotation results only if the binary's larger member already spins quickly and the merger with the smaller hole is consistently near prograde, or if the binary's mass ratio approaches unity. If, as some observations have suggested, observed black holes spin rapidly, then this limits the importance of merger scenarios for the growth of black holes.},

abstract = {We incorporate a model for black hole growth during galaxy mergers into the semi-analytical galaxy formation model based on Lambda-CDM proposed by Baugh et al. (2005). Our black hole model has one free parameter, which we set by matching the observed zeropoint of the local correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity. We present predictions for the evolution with redshift of the relationships between black hole mass and bulge properties. Our simulations reproduce the evolution of the optical luminosity function of quasars. We study the demographics of the black hole population and address the issue of how black holes acquire their mass. We find that the direct accretion of cold gas during starbursts is an important growth mechanism for lower mass black holes and at high redshift. On the other hand, the re-assembly of pre-existing black hole mass into larger units via merging dominates the growth of more massive black holes at low redshift. This prediction could be tested by future gravitational wave experiments. As redshift decreases, progressively less massive black holes have the highest fractional growth rates, in line with recent claims of "downsizing" in quasar activity.},

In a pure perturbative framework and by using the Green function method a general scheme of solutions up to $(v/c)^4$ order is shown. Considering the Taylor expansion of a generic function $f$ it is possible to parameterize the solutions by derivatives of $f$. At Newtonian order, $(v/c)^2$, all more important topics about the Gauss and Birkhoff theorem are discussed. The corrections to "standard" gravitational potential ($tt$-component of metric tensor) generated by an extended uniform mass ball-like source are calculated up to $(v/c)^4$ order. The corrections, Yukawa and oscillating-like, are found inside and outside the mass distribution. At last when the limit $f\rightarrow R$ is considered the $f(R)$-gravity converges in General Relativity at level of Lagrangian, field equations and their solutions.},

abstract = {A unique signature of the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm is its peculiar behavior in the vicinity of the points where the total Newtonian acceleration exactly cancels. In the Solar System, these are the saddle points of the gravitational potential near the planets. Typically, such points are embedded into low-acceleration bubbles where modified gravity theories a` la MOND predict significant deviations from Newton's laws. As has been pointed out recently, the Earth-Sun bubble may be visited by the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft in the near future, providing a unique occasion to put these theories to a direct test. In this work, we present a high-precision model of the Solar System's gravitational potential to determine accurate positions and motions of these saddle points and study the predicted dynamical anomalies within the framework of quasi-linear MOND. Considering the expected sensitivity of the LISA Pathfinder probe, we argue that interpolation functions which exhibit a "faster" transition between the two dynamical regimes have a good chance of surviving a null result. An example of such a function is the QMOND analog of the so-called simple interpolating function which agrees well with much of the extragalactic phenomenology. We have also discovered that several of Saturn's outermost satellites periodically intersect the Saturn-Sun bubble, providing the first example of Solar System objects that regularly undergo the intermediate MOND regime.},

abstract = {The tidal breakup of binary star systems by the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of the galaxy has been suggested as the source of both the observed sample of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) in the halo of the Galaxy and the S stars that remain in tight orbits around Sgr A*. Here, we use a post-Newtonian N-body code to study the dynamics of main-sequence binaries on highly elliptical bound orbits whose periapsides lie close to the SMBH, determining the properties of ejected and bound stars as well as collision products. Unlike previous studies, we follow binaries that remain bound for several revolutions around the SMBH, finding that in the case of relatively large periapsides and highly inclined binaries the Kozai resonance can lead to large periodic oscillations in the internal binary eccentricity and inclination. Collisions and mergers of the binary elements are found to increase significantly for multiple orbits around the SMBH, while HVSs are primarily produced during a binary's first passage. This process can lead to stellar coalescence and eventually serve as an important source of young stars at the Galactic center.},

abstract = {Using a distance-limited portion of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7, we have identified 28 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in nearby (d < 80 Mpc) low-mass, low-luminosity dwarf galaxies. The accreting objects at the galaxy centers are expected to be intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with M_BH < 1e6 M_sun. The AGNs were selected using several optical emission-line diagnostics after careful modeling of the continuum present in the spectra. We have limited our survey to objects with spectral characteristics similar to those of Seyfert nuclei, excluding emission-line galaxies with ambiguous spectra that could be powered by stellar processes. The host galaxies in our sample are thus the least massive objects in the very local universe certain to contain central black holes. Given our focus on the nearest objects included in the SDSS, our survey is more sensitive to low-luminosity emission than previous optical searches for AGNs in low-mass galaxies. The [O III] lambda5007 luminosities of the Seyfert nuclei in our sample have a median value of L_5007 = 2e5 L_sun and extend down to 1e4 L_sun. Using published data for broad-line IMBH candidates, we have derived an [O III] bolometric correction of log (L_bol/L_5007) = 3.0 +/- 0.3, which is significantly lower than values obtained for high-luminosity AGNs. Applying this correction to our sample, we obtain minimum black-hole mass estimates that fall mainly in the 10^3 M_sun -- 10^4 M_sun range, which is roughly where the predicted mass functions for different black-hole seed formation scenarios overlap the most. In the stellar mass range that includes the bulk of the AGN host galaxies in our sample, we derive a lower limit on the AGN fraction of a few percent, indicating that active nuclei in dwarf galaxies are not as rare as previously thought.},

abstract = {We introduce a new method for numerically evolving the full Einstein field equations in situations where the spacetime is dominated by a known background solution. The technique leverages the knowledge of the background solution to subtract off its contribution to the truncation error, thereby more efficiently achieving a desired level of accuracy. We demonstrate the method by applying it to the radial infall of a solar-type star into supermassive black holes with mass ratios $\geq 10^6$. The self-gravity of the star is thus consistently modeled within the context of general relativity, and the star's interaction with the black hole computed with moderate computational cost, despite the over five orders of magnitude difference in gravitational potential (as defined by the ratio of mass to radius). We compute the tidal deformation of the star during infall, and the gravitational wave emission, finding the latter is close to the prediction of the point-particle limit.},

@article{Johannsen2013,
abstract = {According to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are uniquely described by the Kerr metric. In order to test this theorem with observations in either the electromagnetic or gravitational-wave spectra, several Kerr-like spacetimes have been constructed which describe potential deviations from the Kerr spacetime in parametric form. For electromagnetic tests of the no-hair theorem, such metrics allow for the proper modeling of the accretions flows around candidate black holes and the radiation emitted from them. In many of these models, the location of the inner edge of the accretion disk is of special importance. This inner edge is often taken to coincide with the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), which can serve as a direct probe of the spin and the deviation from the Kerr metric. In certain cases, however, an ISCO does not exist, and the inner edge of an accretion disk is instead determined by an instability against small perturbations in the direction vertical to the disk. In this paper, I analyze the properties of accretion disks in the Kerr-like metric proposed by Johannsen and Psaltis (2011), whose inner edges are located at the radii where this vertical instability occurs. I derive expressions of the energy and axial angular momentum of disk particles that move on circular equatorial orbits and calculate the locations of the inner disk edges. As a possible observable of such accretion disks, I simulate profiles of relativistically broadened iron lines and show that they depend significantly on the values of the spin and the deviation parameter.},

If the observed velocities are due solely to the gravitational force of the central body-as in the Solar System-then the mass of the central body can be readily calculated. Here we present observations of rotating gas near the centre of the galaxy NGC4258 (Ml06), which indicate the presence of a mass of 3.6 x 1077solar masses in a region less than 0.13 pc in radius. The volume-averaged mass density in this region exceeds by a factor of at least 40 that for any other black-hole candidate observed previously.

We show that when the condition is not met the limiting process of the algorithm is altered, yielding an asymptotically optimal acceptance rate which might drastically differ from the usual 0.234. Specifically, we prove that as d→∞ the sequence of stochastic processes formed by say the i∗th component of each Markov chain usually converges to a Langevin diffusion process with a new speed measure $\upsilon$, except in particular cases where it converges to a one-dimensional Metropolis algorithm with acceptance rule $\alpha$∗. We also discuss the use of inhomogeneous proposals, which might prove to be essential in specific cases.},

abstract = {{Extreme mass ratio bursts (EMRBs) have been proposed as a possible source for future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These events are characterized by long-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massive black hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists of a short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silent interval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativistic corrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via a geodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections in the waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections are important depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativistic EMRBs (v_{max}}/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately half of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections tend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a Newtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by parameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular importance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter estimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black hole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, such dephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massive black hole and obtain information about its spin.},

abstract = {White dwarf stars are the final evolutionary stage of the vast majority of stars, including our Sun. Since the coolest white dwarfs are very old objects, the present population of white dwarfs contains a wealth of information on the evolution of stars from birth to death, and on the star formation rate throughout the history of our Galaxy. Thus, the study of white dwarfs has potential applications in different fields of astrophysics. In particular, white dwarfs can be used as independent reliable cosmic clocks, and can also provide valuable information about the fundamental parameters of a wide variety of stellar populations, such as our Galaxy and open and globular clusters. In addition, the high densities and temperatures characterizing white dwarfs allow these stars to be used as cosmic laboratories for studying physical processes under extreme conditions that cannot be achieved in terrestrial laboratories. Last but not least, since many white dwarf stars undergo pulsational instabilities, the study of their properties constitutes a powerful tool for applications beyond stellar astrophysics. In particular, white dwarfs can be used to constrain fundamental properties of elementary particles such as axions and neutrinos and to study problems related to the variation of fundamental constants. These potential applications of white dwarfs have led to renewed interest in the calculation of very detailed evolutionary and pulsational models for these stars. In this work, we review the essentials of the physics of white dwarf stars. We enumerate the reasons that make these stars excellent chronometers, and we describe why white dwarfs provide tools for a wide variety of applications. Special emphasis is placed on the physical processes that lead to the formation of white dwarfs as well as on the different energy sources and processes responsible for chemical abundance changes that occur along their evolution. Moreover, in the course of their lives, white dwarfs cross different pulsational instability strips. The existence of these instability strips provides astronomers with a unique opportunity to peer into their internal structure that would otherwise remain hidden from observers. We will show that this allows one to measure stellar masses with unprecedented precision and to infer their envelope thicknesses, to probe the core chemical stratification, and to detect rotation rates and magnetic fields. Consequently, in this work, we also review the pulsational properties of white dwarfs and the most recent applications of white dwarf asteroseismology.},

abstract = {Theoretical considerations of fundamental physics, as well as certain cosmological observations, persistently point out to permissibility, and maybe necessity, of macroscopic modifications of the Einstein general relativity. The field theoretical formulation of general relativity helped us to identify the phenomenological seeds of such modifications. They take place in the form of very specific mass terms, which appear in addition to the field theoretical analog of the usual Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian. We derive and study exact nonlinear equations of the theory, along with its linear approximation. We interpret the added terms as masses of spin-2 and spin-0 gravitons. The arising finite-range gravity is a fully consistent theory, which smoothly approaches general relativity in the massless limit, that is, when both masses tend to zero and the range of gravity tends to infinity. We show that all local weak-field predictions of the theory are in perfect agreement with the available experimental data. However, some other conclusions of the nonlinear massive theory are in a striking contrast with those of general relativity. We show in detail how the arbitrarily small mass terms eliminate the black hole event horizon and replace a permanent power-law expansion of a homogeneous isotropic universe with an oscillatory behaviour. One variant of the theory allows the cosmological scale factor to exhibit an 'accelerated expansion' instead of slowing down to a regular maximum of expansion. We show in detail why the traditional, Fierz-Pauli, massive gravity is in conflict not only with the static-field experiments, but also with the available indirect gravitational-wave observations. At the same time, we demonstrate the incorrectness of the widely held belief that the non-Fierz-Pauli theories possess "negative energies" and "instabilities."},

abstract = {Astrophysical observations are pointing out huge amounts of dark matter and dark energy needed to explain the observed large scale structure and cosmic dynamics. The emerging picture is a spatially flat, homogeneous Universe undergoing the today observed accelerated phase. Despite of the good quality of astrophysical surveys, commonly addressed as Precision Cosmology, the nature and the nurture of dark energy and dark matter, which should constitute the bulk of cosmological matter-energy, are still unknown. Furthermore, up to now, no experimental evidence has been found, at fundamental level, to explain such mysterious components. The problem could be completely reversed considering dark matter and dark energy as shortcomings of General Relativity in its simplest formulation (a linear theory in the Ricci scalar R, minimally coupled to the standard perfect fluid matter) and claiming for the correct theory of gravity as that derived by matching the largest number of observational data, without imposing any theory a priori. As a working hypothesis, accelerating behavior of cosmic fluid, large scale structure, potential of galaxy clusters, rotation curves of spiral galaxies could be reproduced by means of extending the standard theory of General Relativity. In other words, gravity could acts in different ways at different scales and the above shortcomings could be due to incorrect extrapolations of the Einstein gravity, actually tested at short scales and low energy regimes. After a survey of what is intended for Extended Theories of Gravity in the so called metric and Palatini approaches, we discuss some cosmological and astrophysical applications where the issues related to the dark components are addressed by enlarging the Einstein theory to more general f (R) Lagrangians, where f (R) is a generic function of Ricci scalar R, not assumed simply linear. Obviously, this is not the final answer to the problem of dark-components but it can be considered as an operative scheme whose aim is to avoid the addition of unknown exotic ingredients to the cosmic pie.},

abstract = {We analyse f(R) modifications of Einstein's gravity as dark energy models in the light of their connection with chameleon theories. Formulated as scalar-tensor theories, the f(R) theories imply the existence of a strong coupling of the scalar field to matter. This would violate all experimental gravitational tests on deviations from Newton's law. Fortunately, the existence of a matter dependent mass and a thin shell effect allows one to alleviate these constraints. The thin shell condition also implies strong restrictions on the cosmological dynamics of the f(R) theories. As a consequence, we find that the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to be extremely close to -1 in the recent past. We also examine the potential effects of f(R) theories in the context of the Eot-wash experiments. We show that the requirement of a thin shell for the test bodies is not enough to guarantee a null result on deviations from Newton's law. As long as dark energy accounts for a sizeable fraction of the total energy density of the Universe, the constraints which we deduce also forbid any measurable deviation of the dark energy equation of state from -1. All in all, we find that both cosmological and laboratory tests imply that f(R) models are almost coincident with a Lambda-CDM model at the background level.},

The recent discovery of AGN in bulgeless disk galaxies suggests that halo concentration or virial mass may be one of the determining factors in BH mass. Taken together with the result that mass concentration seems to determine spiral arm pitch angle, one would expect a relation to exist between spiral arm pitch angle and supermassive BH mass in disk galaxies, and we find that this is indeed the case. We conclude that this relationship may be important for estimating evolution in BH masses in disk galaxies out to intermediate redshifts, since regular spiral arm structure can be seen in galaxies out to z$\sim$1.},

This means that one can still predict the future outside the event horizon. A black hole on a spacelike surface is defined to be a connected component of the region of the surface bounded by the event horizon. As time increase, black holes may merge together but can never bifurcate. A black hole would be expected to settle down to a stationary state. It is shown that a stationary black hole must have topologically spherical boundary and must be axisymmetric if it is rotating. These results together with those of Israel and Carter go most of the way towards establishing the conjecture that any stationary black hole is a Kerr solution. Using this conjecture and the result that the surface area of black holes can never decrease, one can place certain limits on the amount of energy that can be extracted from black holes.},

abstract = {The inspiral of binary systems in vacuum is controlled by the rate of change of the system's energy, angular momentum and Carter constant. In alternative theories, such a change is induced by the effective stress-energy carried away by gravitational radiation and any other propagating degrees of freedom. We employ perturbation theory and the short-wavelength approximation to compute this stress-energy tensor in a wide class of alternative theories. We find that this tensor is generally a modification of that first computed by Isaacson, where the corrections can dominate over the general relativistic term. In a wide class of theories, however, these corrections identically vanish at asymptotically flat, future, null infinity, reducing the stress-energy tensor to Isaacson's. We exemplify this phenomenon by first considering dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity, which corrects the action via a scalar field and the contraction of the Riemann tensor and its dual. We then consider a wide class of theories with dynamical scalar fields coupled to higher-order curvature invariants, and show that the gravitational wave stress-energy tensor still reduces to Isaacson's. The calculations presented in this paper are crucial to perform systematic tests of such modified gravity theories through the orbital decay of binary pulsars or through gravitational wave observations.},

abstract = {Abbreviated: We investigate the potential of detecting the gravitational wave from individual binary black hole systems using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and calculate the accuracy for determining the GW properties. This is done in a consistent analysis, which at the same time accounts for the measurement of the pulsar distances via the timing parallax. We find that, at low redshift, a PTA is able to detect the nano-Hertz GW from super massive black hole binary systems with masses of $\sim10^8 - 10^{10}\,M_{\sun}$ less than $\sim10^5$\,years before the final merger, and those with less than $\sim10^3 - 10^4$ years before merger may allow us to detect the evolution of binaries. We derive an analytical expression to describe the accuracy of a pulsar distance measurement via timing parallax. We consider five years of bi-weekly observations at a precision of 15\,ns for close-by ($\sim 0.5 - 1$\,kpc) pulsars. Timing twenty pulsars would allow us to detect a GW source with an amplitude larger than $5\times 10^{-17}$. We calculate the corresponding GW and binary orbital parameters and their measurement precision. The accuracy of measuring the binary orbital inclination angle, the sky position, and the GW frequency are calculated as functions of the GW amplitude. We note that the "pulsar term", which is commonly regarded as noise, is essential for obtaining an accurate measurement for the GW source location. We also show that utilizing the information encoded in the GW signal passing the Earth also increases the accuracy of pulsar distance measurements. If the gravitational wave is strong enough, one can achieve sub-parsec distance measurements for nearby pulsars with distance less than $\sim 0.5 - 1$\,kpc.},

abstract = {Gravitational-wave observations of compact binaries have the potential to uncover the distribution of masses and angular momenta of black holes and neutron stars in the universe. The binary components' physical parameters can be inferred from their effect on the phasing of the gravitational-wave signal, but a partial degeneracy between the components' mass ratio and their angular momenta limits our ability to measure the individual component masses. At the typical signal amplitudes expected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (signal-to-noise ratios between 10 and 20), we show that it will in many cases be difficult to distinguish whether the components are neutron stars or black holes. We identify when the masses of the binary components could be unambiguously measured outside the range of current observations: a system with a chirp mass $\mathcal{M} \le 0.871 $ M$_\odot$ would unambiguously contain the smallest-mass neutron star observed, and a system with $\mathcal{M} \ge 2.786 \Msun$ must contain a black hole. However, additional information would be needed to distinguish between a binary containing two 1.35 M$_\odot$ neutron stars and an exotic neutron-star--black-hole binary. We also identify those configurations that could be unambiguously identified as black-hole binaries, and show how the observation of an electromagnetic counterpart to a neutron-star--black-hole binary could be used to constrain the black-hole spin.},

abstract = {We present the results of searches for gravitational waves from a large selection of pulsars using data from the most recent science runs (S6, VSR2 and VSR4) of the initial generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory) and Virgo. We do not see evidence for gravitational wave emission from any of the targeted sources but produce upper limits on the emission amplitude. We highlight the results from seven young pulsars with large spin-down luminosities. We reach within a factor of five of the canonical spin-down limit for all seven of these, whilst for the Crab and Vela pulsars we further surpass their spin-down limits. We present new or updated limits for 172 other pulsars (including both young and millisecond pulsars). Now that the detectors are undergoing major upgrades, and, for completeness, we bring together all of the most up-to-date results from all pulsars searched for during the operations of the first-generation LIGO, Virgo and GEO600 detectors. This gives a total of 195 pulsars including the most recent results described in this paper.},

abstract = {Monitoring the orbits of stars around Sgr A* offers the possibility of detecting the precession of their orbital planes due to frame dragging, of measuring the spin and quadrupole moment of the black hole, and of testing the no-hair theorem. Here we investigate whether the deviations of stellar orbits from test-particle trajectories due to wind mass loss and tidal dissipation of the orbital energy compromise such measurements. We find that the effects of stellar winds are, in general, negligible. On the other hand, for the most eccentric orbits (e>0.96) for which an optical interferometer, such as GRAVITY, will detect orbital plane precession due to frame dragging, the tidal dissipation of orbital energy occurs at timescales comparable to the timescale of precession due to the quadrupole moment of the black hole. As a result, this non-conservative effect is a potential source of systematic uncertainty in testing the no-hair theorem with stellar orbits.},

abstract = {We have continued our long-term study of the double neutron star binary pulsar PSR B1534+12, using new instrumentation to make very high precision measurements at the Arecibo Observatory. We have significantly improved our solution for the astrometric, spin, and orbital parameters of the system as well as for the five ``post-Keplerian'' orbital parameters that can be used to test gravitation theory. The results are in good agreement with the predictions of general relativity. With the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity in the classical regime, our measurements allow us to determine the masses of the pulsar and its companion neutron star with high accuracy: 1.3332+/-0.0010Msolar and 1.3452+/-0.0010Msolar, respectively. The small but significant mass difference is difficult to understand in most evolutionary models, as the pulsar is thought to have been born first from a more massive progenitor star and then undergone a period of mass accretion before the formation of the second neutron star. PSR B1534+12 has also become a valuable probe of the local interstellar medium. We have now measured the pulsar distance to be 1.02+/-0.05 kpc, giving a mean electron density along this line of sight of 0.011 cm-3. We continue to measure a gradient in the dispersion measure, though the rate of change is now slower than in the first years after the pulsar's discovery.},

abstract = {We present a broad-band analysis of deep Suzaku observations of nearby Seyfert 1 AGN: Fairall 9, MCG--6-30-15, NGC 3516, NGC 3783 and NGC 4051. The use of deep observations (exposures >200 ks) with high S/N allows the complex spectra of these objects to be examined in full, taking into account features such as the soft excess, reflection continuum and complex absorption components. After a self-consistent modelling of the broad-band data (0.6-100.0 keV, also making use of BAT data from Swift), the subtle curvature which may be introduced as a consequence of warm absorbers has a measured affect upon the spectrum at energies >3 keV and the Fe K region. Forming a model (including absorption) of these AGN allows the true extent to which broadened diskline emission is present to be examined and as a result the measurement of accretion disc and black hole parameters which are consistent over the full 0.6-100.0 keV energy range.   Fitting relativistic line emission models appear to rule out the presence of maximally spinning black holes in all objects at the 90% confidence level, in particular MCG--6-30-15 at >99.5% confidence. Relativistic Fe K line emission is only marginally required in NGC 3516 and not required in NGC 4051, over the full energy bandpass. Nonetheless, statistically significant broadened 6.4 keV Fe K alpha emission is detected in Fairall 9, MCG--6-30-15 and NGC 3783 yielding black hole spin estimates of a=0.67(+0.10,-0.11), a=0.4(+0.20,-0.12) and a<-0.04 respectively, when fitted with disc emission models.},

abstract = {This paper studies general properties of networks of interferometric gravitational wave detectors in the context of existing detectors (LIGO and VIRGO) and planned and proposed detectors in Japan (LCGT), Australia, and India...I show that the polarization-averaged sensitivity of a network of identical detectors to any class of sources can be characterized by two numbers -- the {\em visibility distance} of the expected source from a single detector and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a confident detection -- and by one function, the antenna pattern of the network. I derive two universal probability distribution functions: for the values of SNR of detected events, and ... for the values of the inclination angle of detected binary systems. The first pdf implies that the most likely value of SNR for the first detected event will be about 1.26 times the threshold SNR of the search. The second implies that, if binary coalescence events are accompanied by narrow-beamed gamma-ray jets, the number of gamma bursts associated with detected coalescence events will be 3.4 times larger than one would expect if there were no correlation between the jet direction and the angular momentum axis of the binary system. ...I propose three figures of merit that characterize the relative performance of different networks...I compare various likely and possible networks, based on these figures of merit. Moving one of the LIGO detectors to Australia (which is under discussion as this paper is being written) improves direction-finding by a factor of 4 or more...Including both LCGT and LIGO-Australia, the network has position error ellipses a factor of 6 smaller in area and a detection capability nearly twice that of the original LIGO-VIRGO network...Using coherent analysis, the enlarged advanced networks can look forward to detecting three to four hundred neutron star binary coalescences per year.},

The structure and cosmological properties of number of modified theories, including traditional $F(R)$ and Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz $F(R)$ gravity, scalar-tensor theory, string-inspired and Gauss-Bonnet theory, non-local gravity, non-minimally coupled models, and power-counting renormalizable covariant gravity are discussed. Different representations and relations between such theories are investigated. It is shown that some versions of above theories may be consistent with local tests and may provide qualitatively reasonable unified description of inflation with dark energy epoch. The cosmological reconstruction of different modified gravities is made in great detail. It is demonstrated that eventually any given universe evolution may be reconstructed for the theories under consideration: the explicit reconstruction is applied to accelerating spatially-flat FRW universe. Special attention is paid to Lagrange multiplier constrained and conventional $F(R)$ gravities, for last theory the effective $\Lambda$CDM era and phantom-divide crossing acceleration are obtained. The occurrence of Big Rip and other finite-time future singularities in modified gravity is reviewed as well as its curing via the addition of higher-derivative gravitational invariants.},

The scientific objective of the LISA Pathfinder mission consists then of the first in-flight test of low frequency gravitational wave detection metrology.

Despite decades of observations, the nature of their "central-engine" remains unknown. Considering a generic binary of magnetized neutron stars and solving Einstein equations, we show that their merger results in a rapidly spinning black hole surrounded by a hot and highly magnetized torus. Lasting over 35 ms and much longer than previous simulations, our study reveals that magnetohydrodynamical instabilities amplify an initially turbulent magnetic field of $\sim$ 10^{12} G to produce an ordered poloidal field of $\sim$ 10^{15} G along the black-hole spin-axis, within a half-opening angle of $\sim$ 30 deg, which may naturally launch a relativistic jet. The broad consistency of our ab-initio calculations with SGRB observations shows that the merger of magnetized neutron stars can provide the basic physical conditions for the central-engine of SGRBs.},

abstract = {It has for long been an article of faith among astrophysicists that black hole spin energy is responsible for powering the relativistic jets seen in accreting black holes. Two recent advances have strengthened the case. First, numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accreting spinning black holes show that relativistic jets form spontaneously. In at least some cases, there is unambiguous evidence that much of the jet energy comes from the black hole, not the disk. Second, spin parameters of a number of accreting stellar-mass black holes have been measured. For ballistic jets from these systems, it is found that the radio luminosity of the jet correlates with the spin of the black hole. This suggests a causal relationship between black hole spin and jet power, presumably due to a generalized Penrose process.},

abstract = {Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are expected to segregate and form a steep density cusp around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei. We follow the evolution of a multimass system of BHs and stars by numerically integrating the Fokker-Planck energy diffusion equations for a variety of BH mass distributions. We find that the BHs `self-segregate', and that the rarest, most massive BHs dominate the scattering rate closest to the SMBH (<$\sim$10-1pc). BH-BH binaries form out of gravitational wave emission during BH encounters. We find that the expected rate of BH coalescence events detectable by Advanced LIGO is $\sim$1-102yr-1, depending on the initial mass function of stars in galactic nuclei and the mass of the most massive BHs. We find that the actual merger rate is likely $\sim$10 times larger than this due to the intrinsic scatter of stellar densities in many different galaxies. The BH binaries that form this way in galactic nuclei have significant eccentricities as they enter the LIGO band (90 per cent with e > 0.9), and are therefore distinguishable from other binaries, which circularize before becoming detectable. We also show that eccentric mergers can be detected to larger distances and greater BH masses than circular mergers, up to $\sim$700Msolar. Future ground-based gravitational wave observatories will be able to constrain both the mass function of BHs and stars in galactic nuclei.},

As a consistency check, our model broadly reproduces a number of observations, e.g. the cosmic star formation history, the black hole mass and luminosity function and the galaxy mass function at low redshift, the black hole to bulge mass relation, and the morphological distribution at low redshift. For the first time in a semianalytical investigation, we relax the simplifying assumptions of perfect coherency or perfect isotropy of the gas fueling the black holes. The dynamics of gas is instead linked to the morphological properties of the host galaxies, resulting in different spin distributions for black holes hosted in different galaxy types. We compare our results with the observed sample of spin measurements obtained through broad K-alpha iron line fitting. The observational data disfavor both accretion along a fixed direction and isotropic fueling. Conversely, when the properties of the accretion flow are anchored to the kinematics of the host galaxy, we obtain a good match between theoretical expectations and observations. A mixture of coherent accretion and phases of activity in which the gas dynamics is similar to that of the stars in bulges (i.e., with a significant velocity dispersion superimposed to a net rotation) best describes the data, adding further evidence in support to the coevolution of massive black holes and their hosts.},

EMRBs are a relatively unexplored means of probing the spacetime of massive black holes (MBHs). We conduct an investigation of the properties of EMRBs and how they could allow us to constrain the parameters, such as spin, of the Galaxy's MBH. We find that if an EMRB event occurs in the Galaxy, it should be detectable for periapse distances r_p < 65 r_g for a \mu = 10 M_sol orbiting object, where r_g = GM/c^2 is the gravitational radius. The signal-to-noise ratio scales as \rho $\sim$ -2.7 log(r_p/r_g) + log(\mu/M_sol) + 4.9. For periapses r_p < 10 r_g, EMRBs can be informative, and provide good constraints on both the MBH's mass and spin. Closer orbits provide better constraints, with the best giving accuracies of better than one part in 10^4 for both the mass and spin parameter.},

abstract = {Measurements of the times of arrival of pulsar signals at Earth provide uniquely powerful tools for experiments in relativistic gravity. The results of such experiments improve rapidly as the span of repeated observations lengthens, and in one instance the relevant data span is now approaching 20 years. The author briefly summarizes and updates two of the most important results of pulsar timing experiments pertinent to relativity and gravitation. The rate of orbital period decay of binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 has been measured with accuracy 0.35%, and is found to be in excellent accord with the prediction for gravitational radiation damping in general relativity. A more recently discovered binary pulsar system, PSR B1534+12 has provided a unique test of strong-field gravitational effects-and these results, too, are fully consistent with relativity.},

abstract = {Galactic nuclei are densely populated by stellar mass compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. Bound, highly eccentric binaries form as a result of gravitational wave (GW) losses during close flybys between these objects. We study the evolution of these systems using 2.5 and 3.5 order post-Newtonian equations of motion. The GW signal consists of many thousand repeated bursts (RB) for minutes to days (depending on the impact parameter and masses), followed by a powerful GW chirp and an eccentric merger. We show that a significant signal to noise ratio (SNR) accumulates already in the RB phase, corresponding to a detection limit around 200-300 Mpc and 300--600 Mpc for Advanced LIGO for an average orientation BH/NS or BH/BH binary, respectively. The theoretical errors introduced by the inaccuracy of the PN templates are typically much less severe for the RB phase than in the following eccentric merger. The GW signal in the RB phase is broadband; we show that encounters involving intermediate mass black holes are detectable in multiple frequency bands coincidentally using LIGO and LISA.},

abstract = {From a sample of 72 galaxies with reliable supermassive black hole masses M_(bh), we derive the M_(bh)-(host spheroid luminosity, L) relation for (i) the subsample of 24 core-Sersic galaxies with partially depleted cores, and (ii) the remaining subsample of 48 Sersic galaxies. Using (K_s)-band Two Micron All Sky Survey data, we find the near-linear relation M_(bh) $\sim$ L_(K_s)^(1.10+/-0.20) for the core-Sersic spheroids thought to be built in additive dry merger events, while M_(bh) $\sim$ L_(K_s)^(2.73+/-0.55) for the Sersic spheroids built from gas-rich processes. After converting literature B-band disk galaxy magnitudes into inclination- and dust-corrected bulge magnitudes, via a useful new equation presented herein, we obtain a similar result. Unlike with the M_(bh)-sigma diagram, which is also updated here using the same galaxy sample, it remains unknown whether barred and non-barred Sersic galaxies are offset from each other in the M_(bh)-L diagram. While black hole feedback has typically been invoked to explain the near-linear `Magorrian relations' and what was previously thought to be a nearly constant M_(bh)/M_(spheroid) mass ratio of $\sim$0.2%, we advocate that the near-linear M_(bh)-L and M_(bh)-M_(spheroid) relations at high masses may have instead largely arisen from the simple, additive dry merging of galaxies, and that feedback results in a dramatically different scaling relation. We therefore introduce a new, quadratic cold-gas 'quasar' mode feeding equation for semi-analytical models to reflect the quadratic mass growth of black holes in Sersic galaxies built amidst gas-rich processes. Finally, we use our new Sersic M_(bh)-L equations to predict the masses of candidate intermediate mass black holes in almost 50 low luminosity spheroids containing active galactic nuclei, possibly having discovered the missing population between stellar mass and supermassive black holes.},

abstract = {The environment near super massive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei contain a large number of stars and compact objects. A fraction of these are likely to be members of binaries. Here we discuss the binary population of stellar black holes and neutron stars near SMBHs and focus on the secular evolution of such binaries, due to the perturbation by the SMBH. Binaries with highly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the SMBH are strongly affected by secular Kozai processes, which periodically change their eccentricities and inclinations (Kozai-cycles). During periapsis approach, at the highest eccentricities during the Kozai-cycles, gravitational wave emission becomes highly efficient. Some binaries in this environment can inspiral and coalesce at timescales much shorter than a Hubble time and much shorter than similar binaries which do not reside near a SMBH. The close environment of SMBHs could therefore serve as catalyst for the inspiral and coalescence of binaries, and strongly affect their orbital properties. Such compact binaries would be detectable as gravitational wave (GW) sources by the next generation of GW detectors (e.g. advanced- LIGO). About 0.5% of such nuclear merging binaries will enter the LIGO observational window while on orbit that are still very eccentric (e>$\sim$0.5). The efficient gravitational wave analysis for such systems would therefore require the use of eccentric templates. We also find that binaries very close to the MBH could evolve through a complex dynamical (non-secular) evolution leading to emission of several GW pulses during only a few yrs (though these are likely to be rare). Finally, we note that the formation of close stellar binaries, X-ray binaries and their merger products could be induced by similar secular processes, combined with tidal friction rather than GW emission as in the case of compact object binaries.},

abstract = {A key source for LISA will be the inspiral of compact objects into massive black holes. Recently Mino has shown that in the adiabatic limit, gravitational waveforms for these sources can be computed by using for the radiation reaction force the gradient of one half the difference between the retarded and advanced metric perturbations. Using post-Newtonian expansions, we argue that the resulting waveforms should be sufficiently accurate for signal detection with LISA. Data-analysis templates will require higher accuracy, going beyond adiabaticity; this remains a significant challenge. We describe an explicit computational procedure for obtaining waveforms based on Mino's result, for the case of a point particle coupled to a scalar field. We derive an explicit expression for the time-averaged time derivative of the Carter constant, and verify that the expression correctly predicts that circular orbits remain circular while evolving under the influence of radiation reaction. The derivation uses detailed properties of mode expansions, Green's functions and bound geodesic orbits in the Kerr spacetime, which we review in detail. This paper is about three quarters review and one quarter new material. The intent is to give a complete and self-contained treatment of scalar radiation reaction in the Kerr spacetime, in a single unified notation, starting with the Kerr metric, and ending with formulae for the time evolution of all three constants of the motion that are sufficiently explicit to be used immediately in a numerical code.},

abstract = {Metric-affine theories of gravity provide an interesting alternative to General Relativity: in such an approach, the metric and the affine (not necessarily symmetric) connection are independent quantities. Furthermore, the action should include covariant derivatives of the matter fields, with the covariant derivative naturally defined using the independent connection. As a result, in metric-affine theories a direct coupling involving matter and connection is also present. The role and the dynamics of the connection in such theories is explored. We employ power counting in order to construct the most general action and search for the minimal requirements it should satisfy for the connection to be dynamical. We find that for the most general action containing lower order invariants the independent connection does not carry any dynamics. It actually reduces to the role of an auxiliary field and can be completely eliminated algebraically in favour of the metric and the matter field, introducing extra interactions with respect to general relativity. However, we also show that including higher order terms in the action radically changes this picture and excites new degrees of freedom in the connection, making it (or parts of it) dynamical. Constructing actions that constitute exceptions to this rule requires significant fine tuned and/or extra {\em a priori} constraints on the connection. We also consider f(R) actions as a particular example in order to show that they constitute a distinct class of metric-affine theories with special properties, and as such they cannot be used as representative toy theories to study the properties of metric-affine gravity.},

These models have both flat and de Sitter spacetimes as particular solutions in the absence of matter. Thus, a cosmological constant is zero in a flat spacetime, but appears effectively in a curved one for sufficiently large R. A smoking gun for these models would be a small discrepancy in the values of the slope of the primordial perturbation power spectrum determined from galaxy surveys and CMB fluctuations. On the other hand, a new problem for dark energy models based on f(R) gravity is pointed out, which is connected with the possible overproduction of new massive scalar particles (scalarons) arising in this theory in the very early Universe.},

Explicit solutions are provided for several different types of Lagrangians containing powers of the Ricci scalar as well as combinations of the other curvature invariants.

abstract = {There is general agreement that the MiSaTaQuWa equations should describe the motion of a 'small body' in general relativity, taking into account the leading order self-force effects. However, previous derivations of these equations have made a number of ad hoc assumptions and/or contain a number of unsatisfactory features. For example, all previous derivations have invoked, without proper justification, the step of 'Lorenz gauge relaxation', wherein the linearized Einstein equation is written in the form appropriate to the Lorenz gauge, but the Lorenz gauge condition is then not imposed—thereby making the resulting equations for the metric perturbation inequivalent to the linearized Einstein equations. (Such a 'relaxation' of the linearized Einstein equations is essential in order to avoid the conclusion that 'point particles' move on geodesics.) In this paper, we analyze the issue of 'particle motion' in general relativity in a systematic and rigorous way by considering a one-parameter family of metrics, gab($\lambda$), corresponding to having a body (or black hole) that is 'scaled down' to zero size and mass in an appropriate manner. We prove that the limiting worldline of such a one-parameter family must be a geodesic of the background metric, gab($\lambda$ = 0). Gravitational self-force—as well as the force due to coupling of the spin of the body to curvature—then arises as a first-order perturbative correction in $\lambda$ to this worldline. No assumptions are made in our analysis apart from the smoothness and limit properties of the one-parameter family of metrics, gab($\lambda$). Our approach should provide a framework for systematically calculating higher order corrections to gravitational self-force, including higher multipole effects, although we do not attempt to go beyond first-order calculations here. The status of the MiSaTaQuWa equations is explained.},

Strengthening the proposal of previous authors, we show that the Bullet Cluster is dominated by a collisionless-most probably nonbaryonic-component in GR as well as in MOND, a result consistent with the dynamics of many X-ray clusters. Our findings add to the number of known pathologies for a purely baryonic MOND, including its inability to fit the latest data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. A plausible resolution of all these issues and standard issues of cold dark matter (CDM) with galaxy rotation curves is the ``marriage'' of MOND with ordinary hot neutrinos of 2 eV. This prediction is just within the GR-independent maximum of neutrino mass from current $\beta$-decay experiments and will be falsifiable by the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment by 2009.

Our galaxies contain four mass groups, representative of old stellar populations; a primary goal is to understand the distribution of stellar-mass BHs after the merger. Mergers are followed using direct-summation N-body simulations, assuming a mass ratio of 1:3 and two different orbits. Evolution of the massive BH binary is followed until its separation has shrunk by a factor of 20 below the hard-binary separation. During the galaxy merger, large cores are carved out in the stellar distribution, with radii several times the influence radius of the massive BH. Much of the pre-existing mass segregation is erased during this phase. We follow the evolution of the merged galaxies for approximately three, central relaxation times after coalescence of the massive binary; both standard, and top-heavy, mass functions are considered. The cores that were formed in the stellar distribution persist, and the distribution of the stellar-mass black holes evolves against this essentially fixed background. Even after three central relaxation times, these models look very different from the relaxed, multi-mass models that are often assumed to describe the distribution of stars and stellar remnants near a massive BH; in particular, the density of stellar BHs is much smaller than in those models.

In addition to the linear relation, logMbh=(7.81+/-0.08)+(2.69+/-0.28)log(n/3) with ɛintrinsic=0.31+0.09-0.07 dex, we investigated the possibility of a higher order Mbh-n relation, finding the second-order term in the best-fitting quadratic relation to be inconsistent with a value of zero at greater than the 99.99% confidence level. The optimal relation is given by logMbh=(7.98+/-0.09)+(3.70+/-0.46)log(n/3)-(3.10+/-0.84)[log(n/3)]2, with ɛintrinsic=0.18+0.07-0.06 dex and a total absolute scatter of 0.31 dex. When the quadratic relation is extrapolated, it predicts black holes with masses of $\sim$103 Msolar in n=0.5 dwarf elliptical galaxies, compared to $\sim$105 Msolar from the linear relation, and an upper bound on the largest black hole masses in the local universe equal to 1.2+2.6-0.4×109 Msolar. In addition, we show that the nuclear star clusters at the centers of low-luminosity elliptical galaxies follow an extrapolation of the same quadratic relation, strengthening suggestions for a possible evolutionary link between supermassive black holes and nuclear star clusters. Moreover, we speculate that the merger of two such nucleated galaxies, accompanied by the merger and runaway collision of their central star clusters, could result in the late-time formation of some supermassive black holes. Finally, we predict the existence of, and provide equations for, an Mbh-$\mu$0 relation, in which $\mu$0 is the (extrapolated) central surface brightness of a bulge.},

abstract = {An expected source of gravitational waves for future detectors in space are the inspirals of small compact objects into much more massive black holes. These sources have the potential to provide a wealth of information about astronomy and fundamental physics. On short timescales the orbit of the small object is approximately geodesic. Generic geodesics for a Kerr black hole spacetime have a complete set of integrals and can be characterized by three frequencies of the motion. Over the course of an inspiral, a typical system will pass through resonances where two of these frequencies become commensurate. The effect of the resonance will be to alter significantly the rate of inspiral for the duration of the resonance. Understanding the impact of these resonances on gravitational wave phasing is important to detect and exploit these signals for astrophysics and fundamental physics. Two differential equations that might describe the passage of an inspiral through such a resonance are investigated. These differ depending on whether it is the phase or the frequency components of a Fourier expansion of the motion that are taken to be continuous through the resonance. Asymptotic and hyperasymptotic analysis are used to find the late-time analytic behavior of the solution for a system that has passed through a resonance. Linearly growing (weak resonances) or linearly decaying (strong resonances) solutions are found depending on the strength of the resonance. In the weak-resonance case, frequency resonances leave an imprint (a resonant memory) on the gravitational frequency evolution. The transition between weak and strong resonances is characterized by a square-root singularity, and as one approaches this transition from above, the solutions to the frequency resonance equation bunch up into families exponentially fast.},

abstract = {We solve the geodesic deviation equations for the orbital motions in the Schwarzschild metric which are close to a circular orbit. It turns out that in this particular case the equations reduce to a linear system, which after diagonalization describes just a collection of harmonic oscillators with two characteristic frequencies. The new geodesic obtained by adding this solution to the circular one, describes not only the linear approximation of Kepler's laws but also gives the right value of the perihelion advance (in the limit of almost circular orbits). We also derive the equations for higher order deviations and show how these equations lead to better approximations including the non-linear effects. The approximate orbital solutions are then inserted into the quadrupole formula to estimate the gravitational radiation from non-circular orbits.},

@article{Weisberg2010,
abstract = {We present results of more than three decades of timing measurements of the first known binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16. Like most other pulsars, its rotational behavior over such long time scales is significantly affected by small-scale irregularities not explicitly accounted for in a deterministic model. Nevertheless, the physically important astrometric, spin, and orbital parameters are well determined and well decoupled from the timing noise. We have determined a significant result for proper motion, $\mu_{\alpha} = -1.43\pm0.13$, $\mu_{\delta}=-0.70\pm0.13$ mas yr$^{-1}$. The pulsar exhibited a small timing glitch in May 2003, with ${\Delta f}/f=3.7\times10^{-11}$, and a smaller timing peculiarity in mid-1992. A relativistic solution for orbital parameters yields improved mass estimates for the pulsar and its companion, $m_1=1.4398\pm0.0002 \ M_{\sun}$ and $m_2=1.3886\pm0.0002 \ M_{\sun}$. The system's orbital period has been decreasing at a rate $0.997\pm0.002$ times that predicted as a result of gravitational radiation damping in general relativity. As we have shown before, this result provides conclusive evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation as predicted by Einstein's theory.},

abstract = {Extended Theories of Gravity can be considered a new paradigm to cure shortcomings of General Relativity at infrared and ultraviolet scales. They are an approach that, by preserving the undoubtedly positive results of Einstein's Theory, is aimed to address conceptual and experimental problems recently emerged in Astrophysics, Cosmology and High Energy Physics. In particular, the goal is to encompass, in a self-consistent scheme, problems like Inflation, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Large Scale Structure and, first of all, to give at least an effective description of Quantum Gravity. We review the basic principles that any gravitational theory has to follow. The geometrical interpretation is discussed in a broad perspective in order to highlight the basic assumptions of General Relativity and its possible extensions in the general framework of gauge theories. Principles of such modifications are presented, focusing on specific classes of theories like f (R)-gravity and scalar-tensor gravity in the metric and Palatini approaches. The special role of torsion is also discussed. The conceptual features of these theories are fully explored and attention is payed to the issues of dynamical and conformal equivalence between them considering also the initial value problem. A number of viability criteria are presented considering the post-Newtonian and the post-Minkowskian limits. In particular, we discuss the problems of neutrino oscillations and gravitational waves in Extended Gravity. Finally, future perspectives of Extended Gravity are considered with possibility to go beyond a trial and error approach.},

We compile published measurements of both MBH and sigma_GC for a sample of 13 systems and find the relation log(MBH) = alpha + beta log(sigma_GC/200) with alpha = 8.64 \pm 0.09 and beta = 3.78 \pm 0.53. We also consider blue (metal-poor) and red (metal-rich) globular clusters sub-populations separately and obtain a tighter correlation using only the velocity dispersion sigma_GC^red of the red clusters with an intrinsic scatter eps_0 = 0.20 dex compared to eps_0 = 0.27 dex for the MBH - sigma_b of our sample. We use our MBH - sigma_GC relation to predict the masses of black holes in 5 galaxies for which sigma_GC^red is measured.

We show that in addition to the well known AQUAL formulation (which we dub Type III), another possibility exists in the form of a driven Poisson equation for the MONDian field. We look at similar quantitative and qualitative analysis in this theory and also investigate typical Signal to Noise Ratios (SNR) resulting from these theories for a typical LPF test. We show that a typical 50 km fly-by would amplify the SNR from 28 to 35 between the two theories. We also suggest that SNR will be enhanced for impact parameters as large as 1000km or larger. Null constraints however remain as good but no better in this formulation than any other.},

We show that if the central body is not a BH but its metric is stationary, axisymmetric, reflection symmetric and asymptotically flat, then the waves will likely be triperiodic, as for a BH. We suggest that the evolutions of the waves’ three fundamental frequencies and of the complex amplitudes of their spectral components encode (in principle) details of the central body’s metric, the energy and angular momentum exchange between the central body and the orbit, and the time-evolving orbital elements.

When the heavy stars are relatively common ($\Delta$ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/Gt.gif] {Gt} 1), they scatter frequently on each other. This efficient self-coupling leads to weak mass segregation, where the stars form ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/697/2/1861/apj300735ieqn1.gif] {$n\propto r^{-\alpha _{M}}$} mass-dependent cusps near the MBH, with indices $\alpha$ H = 7/4 for the heavy stars and 3/2 < $\alpha$ L < 7/4 for the light stars (i.e. max($\alpha$ H – $\alpha$ L ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 1/4).

@article{Harry2014,
abstract = {The first direct detection of neutron-star-black-hole binaries will likely be made with gravitational-wave observatories. Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will be able to observe neutron-star-black-hole mergers at a maximum distance of 900Mpc. To acheive this sensitivity, gravitational-wave searches will rely on using a bank of filter waveforms that accurately model the expected gravitational-wave signal. The angular momentum of the black hole is expected to be comparable to the orbital angular momentum. This angular momentum will affect the dynamics of the inspiralling system and alter the phase evolution of the emitted gravitational-wave signal. In addition, if the black hole's angular momentum is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum it will cause the orbital plane of the system to precess. In this work we demonstrate that if the effect of the black hole's angular momentum is neglected in the waveform models used in gravitational-wave searches, the detection rate of $(10+1.4)M_{\odot}$ neutron-star--black-hole systems would be reduced by $33 - 37%$. The error in this measurement is due to uncertainty in the Post-Newtonian approximations that are used to model the gravitational-wave signal of neutron-star-black-hole inspiralling binaries. We describe a new method for creating a bank of filter waveforms where the black hole has non-zero angular momentum, but is aligned with the orbital angular momentum. With this bank we find that the detection rate of $(10+1.4)M_{\odot}$ neutron-star-black-hole systems would be reduced by $26-33%$. Systems that will not be detected are ones where the precession of the orbital plane causes the gravitational-wave signal to match poorly with non-precessing filter waveforms. We identify the regions of parameter space where such systems occur and suggest methods for searching for highly precessing neutron-star-black-hole binaries.},

abstract = {We propose an improved analytical model for the horizon-absorbed gravitational-wave energy flux of a small body in circular orbit in the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole. Post-Newtonian (PN) theory provides an analytical description of the multipolar components of the absorption flux through Taylor expansions in the orbital frequency. Building on previous work, we construct a mode-by-mode factorization of the absorbed flux whose Taylor expansion agrees with current PN results. This factorized form significantly improves the agreement with numerical results obtained with a frequency-domain Teukolsky code, which evolves through a sequence of circular orbits up to the photon orbit. We perform the comparison between model and numerical data for dimensionless Kerr spins $-0.99 \leq q \leq 0.99$ and for frequencies up to the light ring of the Kerr black hole. Our proposed model enforces the presence of a zero in the flux at an orbital frequency equal to the frequency of the horizon, as predicted by perturbation theory. It also reproduces the expected divergence of the flux close to the light ring. Neither of these features are captured by the Taylor-expanded PN flux. Our proposed absorption flux can also help improve models for the inspiral, merger, ringdown of small mass-ratio binary systems.},

We constrain the deviation parameter b using a combination of geometrical and dynamical observational probes. In particular, we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the recent Supernovae Type Ia data, the Cosmic Microwave Background shift parameters, the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and the growth rate data provided by the various galaxy surveys. This analysis provides constraints for the following parameters: the matter density Omega_{m0}, the deviation from LCDM parameter b and the growth index gamma(z). We parametrize the growth index gamma(z) in three manners (constant, Taylor expansion around z=0, and Taylor expansion around the scale factor). We point out the numerical difficulty for solving the generalized f(R) Friedman equation at high redshifts due to stiffness of the resulting ordinary differential equation. We resolve this problem by constructing an efficient analytical perturbative method in the deviation parameter b. We demonstrate that this method is highly accurate, by comparing the resulting analytical expressions for the Hubble parameter, with the numerical solutions at low and intermediate redshifts. Surprisingly, despite of its perturbative nature, the accuracy of the method persists even for values of b that are of O(1).},

abstract = {We present a model for the inspiral, merger, and ringdown of highly eccentric compact binaries. We map the binary to an effective single black hole system described by a Kerr metric, thereby including certain relativistic effects not incorporated in existing post-Newtonian approximations. The resultant geodesics source quadrupolar radiation and in turn are evolved under its dissipative effects. At the light ring, we attach a merger model that was previously developed for quasicircular mergers but also performs well for eccentric mergers with little modification. We apply our model to assess the detectability of these sources for initial, Enhanced, and Advanced LIGO across the parameter space of nonspinning close capture compact binaries. We conclude that, should these systems exist in nature, the vast majority will be missed by conventional burst searches or by quasicircular waveform templates in the advanced detector era. Other methods, such as eccentric templates or, more practically, a stacked excess power search, must be developed to avoid losing these sources. These systems would also have been missed frequently in the initial LIGO data analysis. Thus, previous null coincidence results with detected GRBs can not exclude the possibility of coincident gravitational wave signals from eccentric binaries.},

abstract = {The Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) experiment provides precise observations of the lunar orbit that contribute to a wide range of science investigations. In particular, time series of highly accurate measurements of the distance between the Earth and Moon provide unique information that determine whether, in accordance with the Equivalence Principle (EP), both of these celestial bodies are falling towards the Sun at the same rate, despite their different masses, compositions, and gravitational self-energies. Analyses of precise laser ranges to the Moon continue to provide increasingly stringent limits on any violation of the EP. Current LLR solutions give (-0.8 +/- 1.3) x 10^{-13} for any possible inequality in the ratios of the gravitational and inertial masses for the Earth and Moon, (m_G/m_I)_E - (m_G/m_I)_M. Such an accurate result allows other tests of gravitational theories. Focusing on the tests of the EP, we discuss the existing data and data analysis techniques. The robustness of the LLR solutions is demonstrated with several different approaches to solutions. Additional high accuracy ranges and improvements in the LLR data analysis model will further advance the research of relativistic gravity in the solar system, and will continue to provide highly accurate tests of the Equivalence Principle.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves (GWs), i.e. small deformations of spacetime traveling at the speed of light, are a fundamental consequence of Einstein's general theory of relativity. There has been no direct observation of GWs so far, although first indirect evidence was found in the observed inspiral of the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16, which agreed to within 1% with the predictions of general relativity [75, 88]. Similar measurements on the recently discovered “double pulsar” system have allowed to improve these experimental tests of General Relativity to the level of 0.05%. GWs are purely transverse waves, characterized by two polarization states (denoted as ‘+’ and ‘×’, respectively). These two polarization bases differ by a rotation of 45° around the propagation axis, corresponding to the quadrupolar (spin-2) nature of the gravitational field. In contrast, the two polarization bases of electromagnetic waves differ by a rotation of 90°, reflecting the dipolar (spin-1) nature of the electromagnetic field.},

@article{Merritt2007,
abstract = {We evaluate the Brownian motion of a massive particle ("black hole") at the center of a galaxy using N-body simulations. Our galaxy models have power-law central density cusps like those observed at the centers of elliptical galaxies. The simulations show that the black hole achieves a steady-state kinetic energy that is substantially different than would be predicted based on the properties of the galaxy model in the absence of the black hole. The reason appears to be that the black hole responds to stars whose velocities have themselves been raised by the presence of the black hole. Over a wide range of density slopes and black hole masses, the black hole's mean kinetic energy is equal to what would be predicted under the assumption that it is in energy equipartition with stars lying within a distance $\sim$r_h/2 from it, where r_h is the black hole's influence radius. The dependence of the Brownian velocity on black hole mass is approximately <V^2>$\sim$ 1/M^{1/(3-gamma)} with gamma the power-law index of the stellar density profile, rho$\sim$1/r^gamma. This is less steep than the 1/M dependence predicted in a model where the effect of the black hole on the stellar velocities is ignored. The influence of a stellar mass spectrum on the black hole's Brownian motion is also evaluated and found to be consistent with predictions from Chandrasekhar's theory. We use these results to derive a probability function for the mass of the Milky Way black hole based on a measurement of its proper motion velocity. Interesting constraints on M will require a velocity resolution exceeding 0.5 km/s.},

@article{MacLeod2014,
abstract = {White dwarfs (WDs) can be tidally disrupted only by massive black holes (MBHs) with masses less than approximately $10^5 M_\odot$. These tidal interactions feed material to the MBH well above its Eddington limit, with the potential to launch a relativistic jet. The corresponding beamed emission is a promising signpost to an otherwise quiescent MBH of relatively low mass. We show that the mass transfer history, and thus the lightcurve, are quite different when the disruptive orbit is parabolic, eccentric, or circular. The mass lost each orbit exponentiates in the eccentric-orbit case leading to the destruction of the WD after several tens of orbits and making it difficult to produce a Swift J1644+57-like lightcurve via this channel. We then examine the stellar dynamics of clusters surrounding these MBHs to show that single-passage WD disruptions are substantially more common than repeating encounters in eccentric orbits. The $10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$ peak luminosity of these events makes them visible to cosmological distances and means that they may be detectible at rates of as many as tens per year by instruments like Swift. In fact, WD-disruption transients significantly outshine their main-sequence star counterparts, and are the most likely tidal interaction to be detected arising from MBHs with masses less than $10^5 M_\odot$. The detection or non-detection of such WD-disruption transients by Swift is, therefore, a powerful tool to constrain lower end of the MBH mass function. The emerging class of ultra-long gamma ray bursts, such as GRB 101225A, GRB 111209A, and GRB 121027A, all have peak luminosities and durations reminiscent of those arising of WD disruptions, offering a hint that WD-disruption transients may already be present in existing datasets.},

abstract = {For galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), it has been observed that the mass of the central black hole (M_BH) tightly correlates with the effective or central velocity dispersion (sigma) of the host galaxy. The origin of this M_BH - sigma scaling relation is assumed to lie in the merging history of the galaxies but many open questions about its origin and the behavior in different mass ranges still need to be addressed. The goal of this work is to study the black-hole scaling relations for low black-hole masses, where the regime of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) is entered. We collect all existing reports of dynamical black-hole measurements in globular clusters, providing black-hole masses or upper limits for 14 candidates. We plot the black-hole masses versus different cluster parameters including total mass, velocity dispersion, concentration and half-mass radius. We search for trends and test the correlations in order to quantify their significance using a set of different statistical approaches. For correlations showing a large significance we perform a linear fit, accounting for uncertainties and upper limits. We find a clear correlation between the mass of the IMBH and the velocity dispersion of the globular cluster. As expected, the total mass of the globular cluster then also correlates with the mass of the IMBH. While the slope of the M_BH - sigma correlation differs strongly from the one observed for SMBHs, the other scaling relations M_BH - M_TOT, and M_BH - L are similar to the correlations in galaxies. Significant correlations of black-hole mass with other cluster properties were not found in the present sample.},

abstract = {The S stars orbiting the Galactic center black hole reach speeds of up to a few percent the speed of light during pericenter passage. This makes, for example, S2 at pericenter much more relativistic than known binary pulsars, and opens up new possibilities for testing general relativity. This paper develops a technique for fitting nearly-Keplerian orbits with perturbations from Schwarzschild curvature, frame dragging, and spin-induced torque, to redshift measurements distributed along the orbit but concentrated around pericenter. Both orbital and light-path effects are taken into account. It turns out that absolute calibration of rest-frame frequency is not required. Hence, if pulsars on orbits similar to the S stars are discovered, the technique described here can be applied without change, allowing the much greater accuracies of pulsar timing to be taken advantage of. For example, pulse timing of 3 microsec over one hour amounts to an effective redshift precision of 30 cm/s, enough to measure frame dragging and the quadrupole moment from an S2-like orbit, provided problems like the Newtonian "foreground" due to other masses can be overcome. On the other hand, if stars with orbital periods of order a month are discovered, the same could be accomplished with stellar spectroscopy from the E-ELT at the level of 1 km/s.},

abstract = {Captures of stellar-mass compact objects (COs) by massive ($\sim 10^6 M_\odot$) black holes (MBHs) are potentially an important source for LISA, the proposed space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detector. The orbits of the inspiraling COs are highly complicated; they can remain rather eccentric up until the final plunge, and display extreme versions of relativistic perihelion precession and Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane. The strongest capture signals will be $\sim$10 times weaker than LISA's instrumental noise, but in principle (with sufficient computing power) they can be disentangled from the noise by matched filtering. The associated template waveforms are not yet in hand, but theorists will very likely be able to provide them before LISA launches. Here we introduce a family of approximate (post-Newtonian) capture waveforms, given in (nearly) analytic form, for use in advancing LISA studies until more accurate versions are available. Our model waveforms include most of the key qualitative features of true waveforms, and cover the full space of capture-event parameters (including orbital eccentricity and the MBH's spin). Here we use our approximate waveforms to (i) estimate the relative contributions of different harmonics (of the orbital frequency) to the total signal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) estimate the accuracy with which LISA will be able to extract the physical parameters of the capture event from the measured waveform. For a typical source (a $10 M_\odot$ CO captured by a $10^6 M_\odot$ MBH at a signal-to-noise ratio of 30), we find that LISA can determine the MBH and CO masses to within a fractional error of $\sim 10^{-4}$, measure $S/M^2$ (where $S$ and $M$ are the MBH's mass and spin) to within $\sim 10^{-4}$, and determine the sky location of the source to within $\sim 10^{-3}$ stradians.},

abstract = {We present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types of compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the Initial and Advanced versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our Galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per Myr per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 per Myr per MWEG to 1000 per Myr per MWEG. We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected sensitivities for our Advanced detectors. Using the detector sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGO-Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between 0.0002 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron-star detection rate for the Advanced LIGO-Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year.},

abstract = {The Galactic Center is an excellent laboratory for studying phenomena and physical occurring in many other galactic nuclei. The Center of our Milky Way is by far the closest galactic nucleus, and observations with exquisite resolution and sensitivity cover 18 orders of magnitude in energy of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretical simulations have become increasingly more powerful in explaining these measurements. This review summarizes the recent progress in observational and theoretical work on the central parsec, with a strong emphasis on the current empirical evidence for a central massive black hole and on the properties of the surrounding dense star cluster. We present the current evidence, from the analysis of the orbits of more than two dozen stars and from the measurements of the size and motion of the central compact radio source, Sgr A*, that this radio source must be a massive black hole of about 4.4 x 106 M_\odot, beyond any reasonable doubt. We report what is known about the structure and evolution of the dense nuclear star cluster surrounding this black hole, including the astounding fact that stars have been forming in the vicinity of Sgr A* recently, apparently with a top-heavy stellar mass function. We discuss a dense concentration of fainter stars centered in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole, three of which have orbital peri-bothroi of less than one light day. This 'S-star cluster' appears to consist mainly of young early-type stars, in contrast to the predicted properties of an equilibrium 'stellar cusp' around a black hole. This constitutes a remarkable and presently not fully understood 'paradox of youth'. We also summarize more briefly what is known about the emission properties of the accreting gas onto Sgr A* and how this emission is beginning to delineate the physical properties in the hot accretion zone around the event horizon.},

abstract = {The orbital-decay rate of a dwarf satellite moving in a spherical parent galaxy is considered on the basis of a theory of dynamical friction applicable to spherical systems, in which the orbits are determined exactly in a given spherical potential U(r). The spherical theory avoids the drag-force divergence that exists in Chandrasekhar's theory (CT), and the results may be regarded as determining the logarithimic factor appearing in CT. For a dwarf galaxy modeled by a Plummer law with a core radius gamma(rs) moving in a circular orbit in a singular isothermal sphere at radius rs, the logarithmic factor is ln Lambda = ln (0.75/gamma), corresponding to p-max = 1.2(rs). The response density of the sphere to the satellite (the satellite wake) is computed and compared with the wake in the infinite homogeneous case.},

@article{Perets2009,
abstract = {In recent years several hypervelocity stars (HVSs) have been observed in the halo of our Galaxy. Such stars are thought to be ejected through dynamical interactions near the massive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic center. Three scenarios have been suggested for their ejection; binary disruption by a MBH, scattering by inspiraling IMBH and scattering by stellar BHs close to MBH. These scenarios involve different stellar populations in the Galactic center. Here we use observations of the Galactic center stellar population together with dynamical and evolutionary arguments to obtain strong constraints on the nature and origin of HVSs. We show that the IMBH inspiral scenario requires too many (O(10^3)) main sequence B stars to exist close to the MBH (<0.01 pc) at the time of inspiral, where current observations show O(10) such stars. Scattering by SBHs also require too many B stars to be observed in the GC, but it may contribute a small fraction of the currently observed HVSs. The binary disruption scenario is still consistent with current observations. In addition it is shown that recently suggested signatures for HVSs origin such as hypervelocity binaries and slow rotating HVSs are much weaker than suggested and require too large statistics. In addition, we show that due to the conditions close to the MBH most binary star systems are not expected to survive for long in this region. Consequently, unique stellar populations that require long evolution in binaries are not expected to be ejected as HVSs in the BHs scattering mechanisms (this may also be related to to the recently observed asymmetry in the velocity distribution of HVSs).},

abstract = {The gravitational wave (GW) signals emitted by a network of cosmic strings are reexamined in view of the possible formation of a network of cosmic superstrings at the end of brane inflation. The reconnection probability $p$ of intersecting fundamental or Dirichlet strings might be much smaller than 1, and the properties of the resulting string network may differ significantly from those of ordinary strings (which have $p=1$). In addition, it has been recently suggested that the typical length of newly formed loops may differ by a factor $\epsilon \ll 1$ from its standard estimate. Here, we analyze the effects of the two parameters $p$ and $\epsilon$ on the GW signatures of strings. We consider both the GW bursts emitted from cusps of oscillating string loops, which have been suggested as candidate sources for the LIGO/VIRGO and LISA interferometers, and the stochastic GW background, which may be detectable by pulsar timing observations. In both cases we find that previously obtained results are \textit{quite robust}, at least when the loop sizes are not suppressed by many orders of magnitude relative to the standard scenario. We urge pulsar observers to reanalyze a recently obtained 17-year combined data set to see whether the large scatter exhibited by a fraction of the data might be due to a transient GW burst activity of some sort, e.g. to a near cusp event.},

If a certain modified version of the Newtonian dynamics is used to describe the motion of bodies in a gravitational field (of a galaxy, say), the observational results are reproduced with no need to assume hidden mass in appreciable quantities. Various characteristics of galaxies result with no further assumptions.

Using the most recent distance estimates to these clusters, we conclude that there are as many potentially observable pulsars in NGC 6440 and NGC 6441 as in Terzan 5. We present timing solutions for all of the pulsars in these globular clusters. Four of the new discoveries are in binary systems; one of them, PSR J1748-2021B (NGC 6440B), has a wide (P_b = 20.5 d) and eccentric (e = 0.57) orbit. This allowed a measurement of its rate of advance of periastron: 0.00391(18) degrees per year. If due to the effects of general relativity, the total mass of this binary system is 2.92 +/- 0.20 solar masses (1 sigma), implying a median pulsar mass of 2.74 +/- 0.21 solar masses. There is a 1 % probability that the inclination is low enough that pulsar mass is below 2 solar masses, and 0.10 % probability that it is between 1.20 and 1.44 solar masses. If confirmed, this anomalously large mass would strongly constrain the equation of state for dense matter. The other highly eccentric binary, PSR J1750-37A, has e = 0.71, and periastron advance of 0.0055(3) degrees per year, implying a total system mass of 1.97 +/-0.15 solar masses and, along with the mass function, maximum and median pulsar masses of 1.65 and 1.26 solar masses respectively.},

abstract = {According to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are uniquely described by their masses and spins. An observational test of the no-hair theorem can be performed by measuring at least three different multipole moments of the spacetime of a black hole and verifying whether their values are consistent with the unique combinations of the Kerr solution. In this paper, we study quasi-periodic variability observed in the emission from black holes across the electromagnetic spectrum as a test of the no-hair theorem. We derive expressions for the Keplerian and epicyclic frequencies in a quasi-Kerr spacetime, in which the quadrupole moment is a free parameter in addition to mass and spin. We show that, for moderate spins, the Keplerian frequency is practically independent of small deviations of the quadrupole moment from the Kerr value, while the epicyclic frequencies exhibit significant variations. We apply this framework to quasi-periodic oscillations in black-hole X-ray binaries in two different scenarios. In the case that a pair of quasi-periodic oscillations can be identified as the fundamental g- and c-modes in the accretion disk, we show that the no-hair theorem can be tested in conjunction with an independent mass measurement. If, on the other hand, the pairs of oscillations are identified with non-parametric resonance of dynamical frequencies in the accretion disk, then testing the no-hair theorem also requires an independent measurement of the black-hole spin. In addition, we argue that VLBI observations of Sgr A* may test the no-hair theorem through a combination of imaging observations and the detection of quasi-periodic variability.},

abstract = {We study gravitational waves in viable $f(R)$ theories under a non-zero background curvature. In general, an $f(R)$ theory contains an extra scalar degree of freedom corresponding to a massive scalar mode of gravitational wave. For viable $f(R)$ models, since there always exits a de-Sitter point where the background curvature in vacuum is non-zero, the mass squared of the scalar mode of gravitational wave is about the de-Sitter point curvature $R_{d}\sim10^{-66}eV^{2}$. We illustrate our results in two types of viable $f(R)$ models: the exponential gravity and Starobinsky models. In both cases, the mass will be in the order of $10^{-33}eV$ when it propagates in vacuum. However, in the presence of matter density in galaxy, the scalar mode can be heavy. Explicitly, in the exponential gravity model, the mass becomes almost infinity, implying the disappearance of the scalar mode of gravitational wave, while the Starobinsky model gives the lowest mass around $10^{-24}eV$, corresponding to the lowest frequency of $10^{-9}$ Hz, which may be detected by the current and future gravitational wave probes, such as LISA and ASTROD-GW.},

abstract = {A "pulsar timing array" (PTA), in which observations of a large sample of pulsars spread across the celestial sphere are combined, allows investigation of "global" phenomena such as a background of gravitational waves or instabilities in atomic timescales that produce correlated timing residuals in the pulsars of the array. The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) is an implementation of the PTA concept based on observations with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. A sample of 20 millisecond pulsars is being observed at three radio-frequency bands, 50cm ($\sim$700 MHz), 20cm ($\sim$1400 MHz) and 10cm ($\sim$3100 MHz), with observations at intervals of 2 - 3 weeks. Regular observations commenced in early 2005. This paper describes the systems used for the PPTA observations and data processing, including calibration and timing analysis. The strategy behind the choice of pulsars, observing parameters and analysis methods is discussed. Results are presented for PPTA data in the three bands taken between 2005 March and 2011 March. For ten of the 20 pulsars, rms timing residuals are less than 1 microsec for the best band after fitting for pulse frequency and its first time derivative. Significant "red" timing noise is detected in about half of the sample. We discuss the implications of these results on future projects including the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) and a PTA based on the Square Kilometre Array. We also present an "extended PPTA" data set that combines PPTA data with earlier Parkes timing data for these pulsars.},

abstract = {We investigate the distribution of neutron star masses in different populations of binaries, employing Bayesian statistical techniques. In particular, we explore the differences in neutron star masses between sources that have experienced distinct evolutionary paths and accretion episodes. We find that the distribution of neutron star masses in non-recycled eclipsing high-mass binaries as well as of slow pulsars, which are all believed to be near their birth masses, has a mean of 1.28 M_solar and a dispersion of 0.24 M_solar. These values are consistent with expectations for neutron star formation in core-collapse supernovae. On the other hand, double neutron stars, which are also believed to be near their birth masses, have a much narrower mass distribution, peaking at 1.33 M_solar but with a dispersion of only 0.05 M_solar. Such a small dispersion cannot easily be understood and perhaps points to a particular and rare formation channel. The mass distribution of neutron stars that have been recycled has a mean of 1.48 M_solar and a dispersion of 0.2 M_solar, consistent with the expectation that they have experienced extended mass accretion episodes. The fact that only a very small fraction of recycled neutron stars in the inferred distribution have masses that exceed $\sim$2 M_solar suggests that only a few of these neutron stars cross the mass threshold to form low mass black holes.},

abstract = {Inspiraling binaries of compact objects are primary targets for current and future gravitational-wave observatories. Waveforms computed in General Relativity are used to search for these sources, and will probably be used to extract source parameters from detected signals. However, if a different theory of gravity happens to be correct in the strong-field regime, source-parameter estimation may be affected by a fundamental bias: that is, by systematic errors induced due to the use of waveforms derived in the incorrect theory. If the deviations from General Relativity are not large enough to be detectable on their own and yet these systematic errors remain significant (i.e., larger than the statistical uncertainties in parameter estimation), fundamental bias cannot be corrected in a single observation, and becomes stealth bias. In this article we develop a scheme to determine in which cases stealth bias could be present in gravitational-wave astronomy. For a given observation, the answer depends on the detection signal-to-noise ratio and on the strength of the modified-gravity correction. As an example, we study three representative stellar-mass binary systems that will be detectable with second-generation ground-based observatories. We find that significant systematic bias can occur whether or not modified gravity can be positively detected, for correction strengths that are not currently excluded by any other experiment. Thus, stealth bias may be a generic feature of gravitational-wave detections, and it should be considered and characterized, using expanded models such as the parametrized post-Einstein framework, when interpreting the results of parameter-estimation analyses.},

abstract = {One of the most exciting potential sources of gravitational waves for low-frequency, space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is the inspiral of compact objects into massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. The detection of waves from such "extreme mass ratio inspiral" systems (EMRIs) and extraction of information from those waves require template waveforms. The systems' extreme mass ratio means that their waveforms can be determined accurately using black hole perturbation theory. Such calculations are computationally very expensive. There is a pressing need for families of approximate waveforms that may be generated cheaply and quickly but which still capture the main features of true waveforms. In this paper, we introduce a family of such "kludge" waveforms and describe ways to generate them. We assess performance of the introduced approximations by comparing "kludge" waveforms to accurate waveforms obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation in the adiabatic limit (neglecting GW backreaction). We find that the kludge waveforms do extremely well at approximating the true gravitational waveform, having overlaps with the Teukolsky waveforms of 95% or higher over most of the parameter space for which comparisons can currently be made. Indeed, we find these kludges to be of such high quality (despite their ease of calculation) that it is possible they may play some role in the final search of LISA data for EMRIs.},

abstract = {The inspiral of a stellar mass ($1 - 100\,M_\odot$) compact body into a massive ($10^5 - 10^7\,M_\odot$) black hole has been a focus of much effort, both for the promise of such systems as astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, and because they are a clean limit of the general relativistic two-body problem. Our understanding of this problem has advanced significantly in recent years, with much progress in modeling the "self force" arising from the small body's interaction with its own spacetime deformation. Recent work has shown that this self interaction is especially interesting when the frequencies associated with the orbit's $\theta$ and $r$ motions are in an integer ratio: $\Omega_\theta/\Omega_r = \beta_\theta/\beta_r$, with $\beta_\theta$ and $\beta_r$ both integers. In this paper, we show that key aspects of the self interaction for such "resonant" orbits can be understood with a relatively simple Teukolsky-equation-based calculation of gravitational-wave fluxes. We show that fluxes from resonant orbits depend on the relative phase of radial and angular motions. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate in simple terms how this phase dependence arises using tools that are good for strong-field orbits, and to present a first study of how strongly the fluxes vary as a function of this phase and other orbital parameters. Future work will use the full dissipative self force to examine resonant and near resonant strong-field effects in greater depth.},

abstract = {We present the first public release of our generic neural network training algorithm, called SKYNET. This efficient and robust machine-learning tool is able to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks, including autoencoders, for use in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications, such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and dimensionality reduction. SKYNET uses a powerful 'pre-training' method, to obtain a set of network parameters close to the true global maximum of the training objective function, followed by further optimisation using an automatically-regularised variant of Newton's method; the latter uses second-order derivative information to improve convergence, but without the need to evaluate or store the full Hessian matrix, by using a fast approximate method to calculate Hessian-vector products. This combination of methods allows for the training of complicated networks that are difficult to optimise using standard backpropagation techniques. SKYNET employs convergence criteria that naturally prevent overfitting, and also includes a fast algorithm for estimating the accuracy of network outputs. The utility and flexibility of SKYNET are demonstrated by application to a number of toy problems, and to astronomical problems focusing on the recovery of structure from blurred and noisy images, the identification of gamma-ray bursters, and the compression and denoising of galaxy images. The SKYNET software, which is implemented in standard ANSI C and fully parallelised using MPI, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/skynet/.},

abstract = {The effect of gravitational radiation reaction on orbits around a spinning black hole is analyzed. Such orbits possess three constants of motion: $\iota$, e, and a, which correspond, in the Newtonian limit of the orbit being an ellipse, to the inclination angle of the orbital plane to the hole's equatorial plane, the eccentricity, and the semimajor axis length, respectively. First, it is argued that circular orbits (e=0) remain circular under gravitational radiation reaction. Second, for elliptical orbits (removing the restriction of e=0), the evolution of $\iota$, e, and a is computed to leading order in S (the magnitude of the spin angular momentum of the hole) and in M/a, where M is the mass of the black hole. As a decreases, $\iota$ increases and e decreases.},

abstract = {During a galaxy merger, the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in each galaxy is thought to sink to the center of the potential and form a supermassive black hole binary; this binary can eject stars via 3-body scattering, bringing the SMBHs ever closer. In a static spherical galaxy model, the binary stalls at a separation of about a parsec after ejecting all the stars in its loss cone -- this is the well-known final parsec problem. Earlier work has shown that the centrophilic orbits in triaxial galaxy models are key in refilling the loss cone at a high enough rate to prevent the black holes from stalling. However, the evolution of binary SMBHs has never been explored in axisymmetric galaxies, so it is not clear if the final parsec problem persists in these systems. Here we use a suite of direct N-body simulations to follow SMBH binary evolution in galaxy models with a range of ellipticity. For the first time, we show that mere axisymmetry can solve the final parsec problem; we find the the SMBH evolution is independent of N for an axis ratio of c/a=0.8, and that the SMBH binary separation reaches the gravitational radiation regime for c/a=0.75.},

In each galaxy, we detect a central black hole (BH) and measure its mass to accuracies ranging from 10% to 70%. We demonstrate that in most cases the BH detection requires both the HST and ground-based data. Using the ground-based data alone does provide an unbiased measure of the BH mass (provided that they are fitted with fully general models), but at a greatly reduced significance. The most significant correlation with host galaxy properties is the relation between the BH mass and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy; we find no other equally strong correlation and no second parameter that improves the quality of the mass-dispersion relation. We are also able to measure the stellar orbital properties from these general models. The most massive galaxies are strongly biased to tangential orbits near the BH, consistent with binary BH models, while lower mass galaxies have a range of anisotropies, consistent with an adiabatic growth of the BH.},

@article{Ivanova2014,
abstract = {The energy budget in common-envelope events (CEEs) is not well understood, with substantial uncertainty even over to what extent the recombination energy stored in ionised hydrogen and helium might be used to help envelope ejection. We investigate the reaction of a red-giant envelope to heating which mimics limiting cases of energy input provided by the orbital decay of a binary during a CEE, specifically during the post-plunge-in phase during which the spiral-in has been argued to occur on a time-scale longer than dynamical. We show that the outcome of such a CEE depends less on the total amount of energy by which the envelope is heated than on how rapidly the energy was transferred to the envelope and on where the envelope was heated. The envelope always becomes dynamically unstable before receiving net heat energy equal to the envelope's initial binding energy. We find two types of outcome, both of which likely lead to at least partial envelope ejection: "runaway" solutions in which the expansion of the radius becomes undeniably dynamical, and superficially "self-regulated" solutions, in which the expansion of the stellar radius stops but a significant fraction of the envelope becomes formally dynamically unstable. Almost the entire reservoir of initial helium recombination energy is used for envelope expansion. Hydrogen recombination is less energetically useful, but is nonetheless important for the development of the dynamical instabilities. However, this result requires the companion to have already plunged deep into the envelope; therefore this release of recombination energy does not help to explain wide post-common-envelope orbits.},

abstract = {We present HST/NICMOS data to study the surface brightness distribution of stellar light within the inner 10" of Sgr A* at 1.4, 1.7 and 1.9 microns. We use these data to independently examine the surface brightness distribution that had been measured previously with NICMOS and to determine whether there is a drop in the surface density of stars very near Sgr A*. Our analysis confirms that a previously reported drop in the surface brightness within 0.8" of Sgr A* is an artifact of bright and massive stars near that radius. We also show that the surface brightness profile within 5" or $\sim$0.2 pc of Sgr A* can be fitted with broken power laws. The power laws are consistent with previous measurements, in that the profile becomes shallower at small radii. For radii > 0.7" the slope is beta=-0.34\pm0.04 where Sigma is proportional to r^beta and becomes flatter at smaller radii with beta=-0.13\pm0.04. Modeling of the surface brightness profile gives a stellar density that increases roughly as r^-1 within the inner 1" of Sgr A*. This slope confirms earlier measurements in that it is not consistent with that expected from an old, dynamically-relaxed stellar cluster with a central supermassive black hole. Assuming that the diffuse emission is not contaminated by a faint population of young stars down to the 17.1 magnitude limit of our imaging data at 1.70$\mu$, the shallow cusp profile is not consistent with a decline in stellar density in the inner arcsecond. In addition, converting our measured diffuse light profile to a stellar mass profile, with the assumption that the light is dominated by K0 dwarfs, the enclosed stellar mass within radius r < 0.1 pc of Sgr A* is $\sim$ 3.2x10^4 M_solar (r/0.1 {pc})^2.1.},

abstract = {The modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm of Milgrom can boast of a number of successful predictions regarding galactic dynamics; these are made without the assumption that dark matter plays a significant role. MOND requires gravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic regime where dynamical accelerations are small. So far relativistic gravitation theories proposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of general relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or violated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an a priori vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory which resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a scalar, and a 4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of its free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic dynamics with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are small. We calculate the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ parameterized post-Newtonian coefficients showing them to agree with solar system measurements. The gravitational light deflection by nonrelativistic systems is governed by the same potential responsible for dynamics of particles. To the extent that MOND successfully describes dynamics of a system, the new theory’s predictions for lensing by that system’s visible matter will agree as well with observations as general relativity’s predictions made with a dynamically successful dark halo model. Cosmological models based on the theory are quite similar to those based on general relativity; they predict slow evolution of the scalar field. For a range of initial conditions, this last result makes it easy to rule out superluminal propagation of metric, scalar, and vector waves.},

The detection of flares from tidally disrupted stars could confirm that these objects are black holes (BHs). Here we present calculations of the stellar disruption rates in detailed dynamical models of real galaxies, taking into account the refilling of the loss cone of stars on disruptable orbits by two-body relaxation and tidal forces in non-spherical galaxies. The highest disruption rates (one star per 10^4 yr) occur in faint (L>10^10 L_sun) galaxies, which have steep central density cusps. More luminous galaxies are less dense and have much longer relaxation times and more massive BHs. Dwarf stars in such galaxies are swallowed whole by the BH and hence do not emit flares; giant stars could produce flares as often as every 10^5 yr, although the rate depends sensitively on the shape of the stellar distribution function. We discuss the possibility of detecting disruption flares in current supernova searches. The total mass of stars consumed over the lifetime of the galaxy is of order 10^6 M_sun, independent of galaxy luminosity; thus disrupted stars may contribute significantly to the present BH mass in galaxies fainter than about 10^9 L_sun.},

abstract = {We quantify the importance of mass accretion during active galactic nuclei (AGN) phases in the growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) by comparing the mass function of black holes in the Local Universe with that expected from AGN relics, which are black holes grown entirely with mass accretion during AGN phases. The local BH mass function (BHMF) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH mass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocity functions. We find that different correlations provide the same BHMF only if they have the same intrinsic dispersion. The density of supermassive black holes in the Local Universe that we estimate is $\rho$BH= 4.6+1.9-1.4h20.7× 105 Msolar Mpc-3. The relic BHMF is derived from the continuity equation with the only assumption that AGN activity is due to accretion on to massive BHs and that merging is not important. We find that the relic BHMF at z= 0 is generated mainly at z < 3 where the major part of the growth of a BH takes place. Moreover, BH growth is antihierarchical in the sense that smaller BHs (MBH < 107 Msolar) grow at lower redshifts (z < 1) with respect to more massive ones (z$\sim$ 1-3). Unlike previous work, we find that the BHMF of AGN relics is perfectly consistent with the local BHMF, indicating that local BHs were mainly grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained while satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the X-ray background (XRB). The comparison between the local and relic BHMFs also suggests that the merging process is not important in shaping the relic BHMF, at least at low redshifts (z < 3), and allows us to estimate the average radiative efficiency (ɛ), the ratio between emitted and Eddington luminosity ($\lambda$) and the average lifetime of active BHs. Our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local BHs grew during AGN phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencies ɛ= 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction $\lambda$= 0.1-1.7 of the Eddington luminosity. The average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from $\sim$= 4.5 × 108 yr for MBH < 108 Msolar to $\sim$= 1.5 × 108 yr for MBH > 109 Msolar, but can become as large as $\sim$109 yr for the lowest acceptable ɛ and $\lambda$ values.},

abstract = {We describe the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for speeding up the code NBODY6 which is widely used for direct $N$-body simulations. Over the years, the $N^2$ nature of the direct force calculation has proved a barrier for extending the particle number. Following an early introduction of force polynomials and individual time-steps, the calculation cost was first reduced by the introduction of a neighbour scheme. After a decade of GRAPE computers which speeded up the force calculation further, we are now in the era of GPUs where relatively small hardware systems are highly cost-effective. A significant gain in efficiency is achieved by employing the GPU to obtain the so-called regular force which typically involves some 99 percent of the particles, while the remaining local forces are evaluated on the host. However, the latter operation is performed up to 20 times more frequently and may still account for a significant cost. This effort is reduced by parallel SSE/AVX procedures where each interaction term is calculated using mainly single precision. We also discuss further strategies connected with coordinate and velocity prediction required by the integration scheme. This leaves hard binaries and multiple close encounters which are treated by several regularization methods. The present nbody6-GPU code is well balanced for simulations in the particle range $10^4-2 \times 10^5$ for a dual GPU system attached to a standard PC.},

abstract = {Gravitational wave science should transform in this decade from a study of what has not been seen to a full-fledged field of astronomy in which detected signals reveal the nature of cataclysmic events and exotic objects. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration have recently completed joint data runs of unprecedented sensitivities to gravitational waves. So far, no gravitational radiation has been seen (although data mining continues). It seems likely that the first detection will come from 2nd-generation LIGO and Virgo interferometers now being installed. These new detectors are expected to detect $\sim$40 coalescences of neutron star binary systems per year at full sensitivity. At the same time, research and development continues on 3rd-generation underground interferometers and on space-based interferometers. In parallel there is a vigorous effort in the radio pulsar community to detect $\sim$several-nHz gravitational waves via the timing residuals from an array of pulsars at different locations in the sky. As the dawn of gravitational wave astronomy nears, this review, intended primarily for interested particle and nuclear physicists, describes what we have learned to date and the prospects for direct discovery of gravitational waves.},

We find a lower limit for the energy from accretion onto black holes of 7% of the total luminosity of the universe and probably more, with 15% quite possible. Comparing these values with the masses of black holes in the center of nearby galaxies, we show that the accretion process must be, on average, very efficient: at least 15% of the accreted mass must be transformed into radiated energy. This further implies that most supermassive black holes are rotating rapidly.},

abstract = {Space-based gravitational wave detectors based on the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) design operate by synthesizing one or more interferometers from fringe velocity measurements generated by changes in the light travel time between three spacecraft in a special set of drag-free heliocentric orbits. These orbits determine the inclination of the synthesized interferometer with respect to the ecliptic plane. Once these spacecraft are placed in their orbits, the orientation of the interferometers at any future time is fixed by Kepler's Laws based on the initial orientation of the spacecraft constellation, which may be freely chosen. Over the course of a full solar orbit, the initial orientation determines a set of locations on the sky were the detector has greatest sensitivity to gravitational waves as well as a set of locations where nulls in the detector response fall. By artful choice of the initial orientation, we can choose to optimize or suppress the antennas sensitivity to sources whose location may be known in advance (e.g., the Galactic Center or globular clusters).},

@article{Sopuerta2009a,
abstract = {[abridged] Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity is a 4D effective theory that descends both from string theory and loop quantum gravity, and that corrects the Einstein-Hilbert action by adding the product of a scalar field and the parity-violating, Pontryagin density. In this theory, the gravitational field of spinning black holes is described by a modified Kerr geometry whose multipole moments deviate from the Kerr ones only at the fourth multipole, l = 4. We investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational wave emission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive black holes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. We use the semi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of the massive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from a multipolar decomposition of the radiative field. The main CS corrections to the waveforms arise from modifications to the geodesic trajectories, due to changes to the massive black hole geometry, and manifest themselves as an accumulating dephasing relative to the general relativistic case. We also explore the propagation and the stress-energy tensor of gravitational waves in this theory. We find that, although this tensor has the same form as in General Relativity, the energy and angular momentum balance laws are indeed modified through the stress-energy tensor of the CS scalar field. These balance laws could be used to describe the inspiral through adiabatic changes in the orbital parameters, which in turn would enhance the dephasing effect. Gravitational-wave observations of intermediate- or extreme-mass ratio inspirals with advanced ground detectors or with LISA could use such dephasing to test the dynamical theory to unprecedented levels.},

@article{Johannsen2013b,
abstract = {According to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are uniquely characterized by their masses and spins and are described by the Kerr metric. Several parametric spacetimes that deviate from the Kerr metric have been proposed in order to test this theorem with observations of black holes in both the electromagnetic and gravitational-wave spectra. Such metrics often contain naked singularities or closed timelike curves in the vicinity of the compact objects, which can limit the applicability of the metrics to compact objects that do not spin rapidly, and generally admit only two constants of motion. The existence of a third constant, however, can facilitate the calculation of observables, because the equations of motion can be written in first-order form. In this paper, I design a Kerr-like black hole metric which is regular everywhere outside of the event horizon, possesses three independent constants of motion, and depends nonlinearly on four free functions that parametrize potential deviations from the Kerr metric. This metric is generally not a solution to the field equations of any particular gravity theory, but can be mapped to known four-dimensional black hole solutions of modified theories of gravity for suitable choices of the deviation functions. I derive expressions for the energy, angular momentum, and epicyclic frequencies of a particle on a circular equatorial orbit around the black hole and compute the location of the innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, I write the metric in a Kerr-Schild-like form, which allows for a straightforward implementation of fully relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows in this metric. The properties of this metric make it a well-suited spacetime for strong-field tests of the no-hair theorem in the electromagnetic spectrum with black holes of arbitrary spin.},

abstract = {The coalescence of a binary black hole can be accompanied by a large gravitational recoil due to anisotropic emission of gravitational waves. A recoiling supermassive black hole (SBH) can subsequently undergo long-lived oscillations in the potential well of its host galaxy, suggesting that offset SBHs may be common in the cores of massive ellipticals. We have analyzed HST archival images of 14 nearby core ellipticals, finding evidence for small ($\lesssim 10$ pc) displacements between the AGN (locating the SBH) and the center of the galaxy (the mean photocenter) in 10 of them. Excluding objects that may be affected by large-scale isophotal asymmetries, we consider six galaxies to have detected displacements, including M87, where a displacement was previously reported by Batcheldor et al. 2010. In individual objects, these displacements can be attributed to residual gravitational recoil oscillations following a major or minor merger within the last few Gyr. For plausible merger rates, however, there is a high probability of larger displacements than those observed, if SBH coalescence took place in these galaxies. Remarkably, the AGN-photocenter displacements are approximately aligned with the radio source axis in four of the six galaxies with displacements, including three of the four having relatively powerful kpc-scale jets. This suggests intrinsic asymmetries in radio jet power as a possible displacement mechanism, although approximate alignments are also expected for gravitational recoil. Orbital motion in SBH binaries and interactions with massive perturbers can produce the observed displacement amplitudes but do not offer a ready explanation for the alignments.},

abstract = {The discovery of radio pulsars in compact orbits around Sgr A* would allow an unprecedented and detailed investigation of the spacetime of the supermassive black hole. This paper shows that pulsar timing, including that of a single pulsar, has the potential to provide novel tests of general relativity, in particular its cosmic censorship conjecture and no-hair theorem for rotating black holes. These experiments can be performed by timing observations with 100 micro-second precision, achievable with the Square Kilometre Array for a normal pulsar at frequency above 15 GHz. Based on the standard pulsar timing technique, we develop a method that allows the determination of the mass, spin, and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*, and provides a consistent covariance analysis of the measurement errors. Furthermore, we test this method in detailed mock data simulations. It seems likely that only for orbital periods below $\sim$0.3 yr is there the possibility of having negligible external perturbations. For such orbits we expect a $\sim$10^-3 test of the frame dragging and a $\sim$10^-2 test of the no-hair theorem within 5 years, if Sgr A* is spinning rapidly. Our method is also capable of identifying perturbations caused by distributed mass around Sgr A*, thus providing high confidence in these gravity tests. Our analysis is not affected by uncertainties in our knowledge of the distance to the Galactic center, R0. A combination of pulsar timing with the astrometric results of stellar orbits would greatly improve the measurement precision of R0.},

We use recent cosmological observations and Bayesian model averaging to derive tight limits on the curvature parameter, as well as robust lower bounds on the curvature radius of the Universe and its minimum size, while allowing for the possibility of an evolving dark energy component. Because flat models are favoured by Bayesian model selection, we find that model-averaged constraints on the curvature and size of the Universe can be considerably stronger than non model-averaged ones. For the most conservative prior choice (based on inflationary considerations), our procedure improves on non model-averaged constraints on the curvature by a factor of $\sim$ 2. The curvature scale of the Universe is conservatively constrained to be R_c > 42 Gpc (99%), corresponding to a lower limit to the number of Hubble spheres in the Universe N_U > 251 (99%).},

EMRBs provide a novel means of extracting information about the MBH; an EMRB from the Galactic MBH could be highly informative regarding the MBH's mass and spin if the orbital periapsis is small enough. However, to be a useful astronomical tool EMRBs must be both informative and sufficiently common to be detectable with a space-based interferometer.

Stellar mass black holes dominate the event rate. Creating a sample of 100 mission realisations, we calculate what we could learn about the MBH.

We have observed 17 pulsars for a span of roughly five years using the Green Bank and Arecibo radio telescopes. We analyze these data using standard pulsar timing models, with the addition of time-variable dispersion measure and frequency-variable pulse shape terms. Sub-microsecond timing residuals are obtained in nearly all cases, and the best root-mean-square timing residuals in this set are $\sim$30-50 ns. We present methods for analyzing post-fit timing residuals for the presence of a gravitational wave signal with a specified spectral shape. These optimally take into account the timing fluctuation power removed by the model fit, and can be applied to either data from a single pulsar, or to a set of pulsars to detect a correlated signal. We apply these methods to our dataset to set an upper limit on the strength of the nHz-frequency stochastic supermassive black hole gravitational wave background of h_c (1 yr^-1) < 7x10^-15 (95%). This result is dominated by the timing of the two best pulsars in the set, PSRs J1713+0747 and J1909-3744.},

abstract = {It is firmly established that the stellar mass distribution is smooth, covering the range 0.1-100 M ⊙. It is to be expected that the masses of the ensuing compact remnants correlate with the masses of their progenitor stars, and thus it is generally thought that the remnant masses should be smoothly distributed from the lightest white dwarfs to the heaviest black holes (BHs). However, this intuitive prediction is not borne out by observed data. In the rapidly growing population of remnants with observationally determined masses, a striking mass gap has emerged at the boundary between neutron stars (NSs) and BHs. The heaviest NSs reach a maximum of two solar masses, while the lightest BHs are at least five solar masses. Over a decade after the discovery, the gap has become a significant challenge to our understanding of compact object formation. We offer new insights into the physical processes that bifurcate the formation of remnants into lower-mass NSs and heavier BHs. Combining the results of stellar modeling with hydrodynamic simulations of supernovae, we both explain the existence of the gap and also put stringent constraints on the inner workings of the supernova explosion mechanism. In particular, we show that core-collapse supernovae are launched within 100-200 ms of the initial stellar collapse, implying that the explosions are driven by instabilities with a rapid (10-20 ms) growth time. Alternatively, if future observations fill in the gap, this will be an indication that these instabilities develop over a longer (&gt;200 ms) timescale.},

abstract = {We consider the interaction between a binary system (e.g. two supermassive black holes or two stars) and an external accretion disc with misaligned angular momentum. This situation occurs in galaxy merger events involving supermassive black holes, and in the formation of stellar--mass binaries in star clusters. We work out the gravitational torque between the binary and disc, and show that their angular momenta J_b, J_d stably counteralign if their initial orientation is sufficiently retrograde, specifically if the angle theta between them obeys cos(theta) < -J_d/2J_b, on a time short compared with the mass gain time of the central accretor(s). The magnitude J_b remains unchanged in this process. Counteralignment can promote the rapid merger of supermassive black hole binaries, and possibly the formation of coplanar but retrograde planets around stars in binary systems.},

@article{Abadie2010a,
abstract = {We present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types of compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the Initial and Advanced versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our Galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per Myr per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 per Myr per MWEG to 1000 per Myr per MWEG. We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected sensitivities for our Advanced detectors. Using the detector sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGO-Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between 0.0002 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron-star detection rate for the Advanced LIGO-Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year.},

abstract = {If gravitation is propagated by a massive field, then the velocity of gravitational waves (gravitons) will depend upon their frequency as (vg/c)2=1-(c/f$\lambda$g)2, and the effective Newtonian potential will have a Yukawa form $\sim$r-1exp(-r/$\lambda$g), where $\lambda$g=h/mgc is the graviton Compton wavelength. In the case of inspiralling compact binaries, gravitational waves emitted at low frequency early in the inspiral will travel slightly slower than those emitted at high frequency later, resulting in an offset in the relative arrival times at a detector. This modifies the phase evolution of the observed inspiral gravitational waveform, similar to that caused by post-Newtonian corrections to quadrupole phasing. Matched filtering of the waveforms could bound such frequency-dependent variations in propagation speed, and thereby bound the graviton mass. The bound depends on the mass of the source and on noise characteristics of the detector, but is independent of the distance to the source, except for weak cosmological redshift effects. For observations of stellar-mass compact inspiral using ground-based interferometers of the LIGO-VIRGO type, the bound on $\lambda$g could be of the order of 6×1012 km, about double that from solar-system tests of Yukawa modifications of Newtonian gravity. For observations of massive black hole binary inspiral at cosmological distances using the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the bound could be as large as 6×1016 km. This is three orders of magnitude weaker than model-dependent bounds from galactic cluster dynamics.},

After the end of the first science run, partially overlapped with the LIGO fifth science run, the detector underwent several upgrades to improve its sensitivity. The second Virgo science run started at the beginning of July 2009 in coincidence with LIGO.

This will lead to a considerable improvement in the sensitivity and represents an intermediate step toward the development of the advanced detectors.},

abstract = {The field equations following from a Lagrangian L(R) will be deduced and solved for special cases. If L is a non-linear function of the curvature scalar, then these equations are of fourth order in the metric. In the introduction we present the history of these equations beginning with the paper of H. Weyl from 1918, who first discussed them as alternative to Einstein's theory. In the third part, we give details about the cosmic no hair theorem, i.e., the details how within fourth order gravity with L= R + R^2 the inflationary phase of cosmic evolution turns out to be a transient attractor. Finally, the Bicknell theorem, i.e. the conformal relation from fourth order gravity to scalar-tensor theory, will be shortly presented.},

abstract = {We describe a one-parameter family of models of stable sperical stellar systems in which the phase-space distribution function depends only on energy. The models have similar density profiles in their outer parts (rho propotional to r-4) and central power-law density cusps, rho proportional to r3-eta, 0 less than eta less than or = 3. The family contains the Jaffe (1983) and Hernquist (1990) models as special cases. We evaluate the surface brightness profile, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile, and the distribution function, and discuss analogs of King's core-fitting formula for determining mass-to-light ratio. We also generalize the models to a two-parameter family, in which the galaxy contains a central black hole; the second parameter is the mass of the black hole. Our models can be used to estimate the detectability of central black holes and the velocity-dispersion profiles of galaxies that contain central cusps, with or without a central black hole.},

abstract = {This document introduces the exciting and fundamentally new science and astronomy that the European New Gravitational Wave Observatory (NGO) mission (derived from the previous LISA proposal) will deliver. The mission (which we will refer to by its informal name "eLISA") will survey for the first time the low-frequency gravitational wave band (about 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz), with sufficient sensitivity to detect interesting individual astrophysical sources out to z = 15. The eLISA mission will discover and study a variety of cosmic events and systems with high sensitivity: coalescences of massive black holes binaries, brought together by galaxy mergers; mergers of earlier, less-massive black holes during the epoch of hierarchical galaxy and black-hole growth; stellar-mass black holes and compact stars in orbits just skimming the horizons of massive black holes in galactic nuclei of the present era; extremely compact white dwarf binaries in our Galaxy, a rich source of information about binary evolution and about future Type Ia supernovae; and possibly most interesting of all, the uncertain and unpredicted sources, for example relics of inflation and of the symmetry-breaking epoch directly after the Big Bang. eLISA's measurements will allow detailed studies of these signals with high signal-to-noise ratio, addressing most of the key scientific questions raised by ESA's Cosmic Vision programme in the areas of astrophysics and cosmology. They will also provide stringent tests of general relativity in the strong-field dynamical regime, which cannot be probed in any other way. This document not only describes the science but also gives an overview on the mission design and orbits.},

abstract = {We analyse 3D SPH simulations of the evolution of initially quasi-circular massive black hole binaries (BHBs) residing in the central hollow (cavity) of self-gravitating circumbinary discs. We perform a set of simulations adopting different thermodynamics for the gas within the cavity and for the 'numerical size' of the black holes. We study the interplay between gas accretion and gravity torques in changing the binary elements (semi-major axis and eccentricity) and its total angular momentum budget. We pay special attention to the gravity torques, by analysing their physical origin and location. We show that (i) the BHB eccentricity grows due to gravity torques from the inner edge of the disc, independently of the accretion and the adopted thermodynamics; (ii) the semi-major axis decay depends not only on the gravity torques but also on their subtle interplay with the disc-binary angular momentum transfer due to accretion; (iii) the spectral structure of the gravity torques is predominately caused by disc edge overdensities and spiral arms developing in the body of the disc; (iv) the net gravity torque changes sign across the BHB corotation radius: gas inside this radius exerts a net positive torque, while streams located outside this radius (but within the cavity) exert a net negative torque. The relative importance of the two might depend on the thermodynamical properties of the instreaming gas and is crucial in assessing the disc--binary angular momentum transfer; (v) the net torque manifests as a purely kinematic effect as it stems from the low density cavity, where the material flows in and out in highly eccentric orbits. Thus both accretion onto the black holes and the interaction with gas streams inside the cavity must be taken into account to assess the fate of the binary.},

This is a field that has been traditionally driven by theoretical work, but in recent years has also generated a great deal of interest and excitement in the observational astronomy community. In particular, the electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to SMBH mergers provide the means to detect and characterize these highly energetic events at cosmological distances, even in the absence of a space-based gravitational-wave observatory. In addition to providing a mechanism for observing SMBH mergers, EM counterparts also give important information about the environments in which these remarkable events take place, thus teaching us about the mechanisms through which galaxies form and evolve symbiotically with their central black holes.},

abstract = {We present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with 154 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that were detected by satellite-based gamma-ray experiments in 2009-2010, during the sixth LIGO science run and the second and third Virgo science runs. We perform two distinct searches: a modeled search for coalescences of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and black hole; and a search for generic, unmodeled gravitational-wave bursts. We find no evidence for gravitational-wave counterparts, either with any individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For all GRBs we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, under the optimistic assumption of a gravitational-wave emission energy of 10^-2 M c^2 at 150 Hz, with a median limit of 17 Mpc. For short hard GRBs we place exclusion distances on binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole progenitors, using astrophysically motivated priors on the source parameters, with median values of 16 Mpc and 28 Mpc respectively. These distance limits, while significantly larger than for a search that is not aided by GRB satellite observations, are not large enough to expect a coincidence with a GRB. However, projecting these exclusions to the sensitivities of Advanced LIGO and Virgo, which should begin operation in 2015, we find that the detection of gravitational waves associated with GRBs will become quite possible.},

abstract = {We investigate the solar-system constraint on the f(R) theory of modified gravity with chameleon mechanism, where f(R) represents the deviation from general relativity in the gravity action. We obtain a stringent bound to a general, non-constant deviation function f(R): -10^{-15} < df/dR < 0 when R $\sim$ 3*10^5*H0^2, and a loose bound: 0 < R*d(df/dR)/dR < 2/5 when R > 3*10^5*H0^2, by requiring the thin-shell condition in the solar system, particularly in the atmosphere of the Earth. These bounds can be conveniently utilized to test the f(R) models with given functional forms of f(R) and to obtain the constraints on the parameters therein. For demonstration we apply these bounds to several widely considered f(R) models. (H0: Hubble constant)},

abstract = {The double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B consists of two neutron stars in a highly relativistic orbit that displays a roughly 30-second eclipse when pulsar A passes behind pulsar B. Describing this eclipse of pulsar A as due to absorption occurring in the magnetosphere of pulsar B, we successfully use a simple geometric model to characterize the observed changing eclipse morphology and to measure the relativistic precession of pulsar B's spin axis around the total orbital angular momentum. This provides a test of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime. Our measured relativistic spin precession rate of 4.77 (+0.66,-0.65) degrees per year (68% confidence level) is consistent with that predicted by general relativity within an uncertainty of 13%.},

@article{Kormendy2013,
abstract = {We review the observed demographics and inferred evolution of supermassive black holes (BHs) found by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass and the velocity dispersion of the host-galaxy bulge. It and other correlations led to the belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. BHs are found in pure-disk galaxies, so classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary to grow BHs. But BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. And any correlations with disk-grown pseudobulges or halo dark matter are so weak as to imply no close coevolution. We suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. 1- Local, stochastic feeding of small BHs in mainly bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. 2- Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers grows giant BHs in short, quasar-like "AGN" events whose feedback does affect galaxies. This makes classical bulges and coreless-rotating ellipticals. 3- At the highest BH masses, maintenance-mode feedback into X-ray gas has the negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating ellipticals. They inherit coevolution magic from smaller progenitors. 4- Independent of any feedback physics, the averaging that results from successive mergers helps to engineer tight BH correlations.},

@article{Havas1977,
abstract = {Three alternative general relativistic theories of gravitation with fourth-order field equations are evaluated which were suggested by Weyl (1919) and Eddington (1924). It is shown that in the presence of extended sources, none of these alternatives leads to Newton's law of gravitation in the nonrelativistic limit. An analysis is performed which indicates that if only asymptotic agreement with Newton's law is required, the Einstein tensor can be supplemented by the introduction of terms involving higher-order derivatives of the metric and universal constants having the dimension of length. It is concluded that: (1) the special theory of relativity can be fitted into an infinity of general relativistic theories, (2) only Einstein's general theory yields an acceptable theory of gravitation without the introduction of additional universal constants, and (3) Birkhoff's (1923) theorem on the existence of a unique one-parameter family of spherically symmetric solutions to the vacuum field equations does not hold for any of the examined generalizations of Einstein's equations.},

@article{Volonteri2005,
abstract = {We study the expected distribution of massive black hole (MBH) spins and its evolution with cosmic time in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation theories. Our model uses Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, coupled with semianalytical recipes, to follow the merger history of dark matter halos, the dynamics of the MBHs they host, and their growth via gas accretion and binary coalescences. The coalescence of comparable-mass holes increases the spin of MBHs, while the capture of smaller companions in randomly oriented orbits acts to spin holes down. We find that, given the distribution of MBH binary mass ratios in hierarchical models, binary coalescences alone do not lead to a systematic spin-up or spin-down of MBHs with time: the spin distribution retains memory of its initial conditions. By contrast, because of the alignment of a MBH with the angular momentum of the outer accretion disk, gas accretion tends to spin holes up even if the direction of the spin axis varies in time. In our models, accretion dominates over black hole captures and efficiently spins holes up. The spin distribution is heavily skewed toward fast-rotating Kerr holes, is already in place at early epochs, and does not change much below redshift 5. If accretion is via a thin disk, about 70% of all MBHs are maximally rotating and have radiative efficiencies approaching 30% (assuming a ``standard'' spin-efficiency conversion). Even in the conservative case in which accretion is via a geometrically thick disk, about 80% of all MBHs have spin parameters a/mBH&gt;0.8 and accretion efficiencies &gt;12%. Rapidly spinning holes with high radiative efficiencies may satisfy constraints based on comparing the local MBH mass density with the mass density inferred from luminous quasars (Soltan's argument). Since most holes rotate rapidly at all epochs, our results suggest that spin is not a necessary and sufficient condition for producing a radio-loud quasar.},

We express the modified Einstein equations using covariant quantities, and derive the gauge-invariant perturbation equations in covariant form. We consider a specific choice of f(T), designed to explain the observed late-time accelerating cosmic expansion without including an exotic dark energy component. Our numerical solution shows that the extra degree of freedom of such f(T) gravity models generally decays as one goes to smaller scales, and consequently its effects on scales such as galaxies and galaxies clusters are small. But on large scales, this degree of freedom can produce large deviations from the standard LCDM scenario, leading to severe constraints on the f(T) gravity models as an explanation to the cosmic acceleration.},

@article{Nelson1999,
abstract = {We apply linear response theory to a general, inhomogeneous, stationary stellar system, with particular emphasis on dissipative processes analogous to Landau damping. Assuming only that the response is causal, we show that the irreversible work done by an external perturber is described by the anti-Hermitian part of a linear response operator, and damping of collective modes is described by the anti-Hermitian part of a related polarization operator. We derive an exact formal expression for the response operator, which is the classical analogue of a well-known result in quantum statistical physics. When the self-gravity of the response can be ignored, and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the ensemble-averaged gravitational potential is integrable, the expressions for the mode energy, damping rate and polarization operator reduce to well-known formulae derived from perturbation theory in action-angle variables. In this approximation, dissipation occurs only via resonant interaction with stellar orbits or collective modes. For stellar systems in thermal equilibrium, the anti-Hermitian part of the response operator is directly related to the correlation function of the fluctuations. Thus dissipative properties of the system are completely determined by the spectrum of density fluctuations - the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In particular, we express the coefficient of dynamical friction for an orbiting test particle in terms of the fluctuation spectrum; this reduces to the known Chandrasekhar formula in the restrictive case of an infinite homogeneous system with a Maxwellian velocity distribution.},

abstract = {We present a pedagogical and phenomenological introduction to the study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization to build intuition about the prospects and challenges facing its detection. Thomson scattering of temperature anisotropies on the last scattering surface generates a linear polarization pattern on the sky that can be simply read off from their quadrupole moments. These in turn correspond directly to the fundamental scalar (compressional), vector (vortical), and tensor (gravitational wave) modes of cosmological perturbations. We explain the origin and phenomenology of the geometric distinction between these patterns in terms of the so-called electric and magnetic parity modes, as well as their correlation with the temperature pattern. By its isolation of the last scattering surface and the various perturbation modes, the polarization provides unique information for the phenomenological reconstruction of the cosmological model. Finally we comment on the comparison of theory with experimental data and prospects for the future detection of CMB polarization.},

Above $r_{c}$ gravity is strengthened and as a consequence weak lensing features are modified compared to the Schwarzschild case. We find a critical impact parameter (depending upon $r_{c}$) for which the behavior of the deflection angle changes. Using the Virbhadra-Ellis lens equation we improve the computation of the image positions, Einstein ring radii, magnification factors and the magnification ratio. We demonstrate that the magnification ratio as function of image separation has a different power-law dependence for each parameter $\sigma $. As these are the lensing quantities most conveniently determined by direct measurements, future lensing surveys will be able to constrain the parameter $\sigma $ based on this prediction.},

We believe the timing model is accurate in its description of predictable systematic timing effects to better than one nanosecond, except in the case of relativistic binary systems where further theoretical development is needed.

abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant ( H 0 ) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n s = 0.968 ± 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑ m $\nu$ < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34 +0.86 –0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0 . The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP +BAO+ H 0 , without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = –1.10 ± 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Y p = 0.326 ± 0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature- E -mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21$\sigma$, compared with 13$\sigma$ from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature- B -mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/192/2/18/apjs374858ieqn1.gif] {$\Delta \alpha =-1\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ $}1\pm 1\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ $}4 (\rm statistical)\pm 1\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ $}5 (\rm systematic)$} (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration.},

Considering a small perturbation from the equilibrium and linearizing the field equations, it can be obtained a dispersion relation. A dispersion equation is achieved for neutral dust-particle systems where a generalized Jeans wave-number is obtained. This analysis gives rise to unstable modes not present in the standard Jeans analysis (derived assuming Newtonian gravity as weak filed limit of $f(R)=R$). In this perspective, we discuss several self-gravitating astrophysical systems whose dynamics could be fully addressed in the framework of $f(R)$-gravity.},

abstract = {The gravitational waves, emitted by a compact object orbiting a much more massive central body, depend on the central body’s spacetime geometry. This paper is a first attempt to explore that dependence. For simplicity, the central body is assumed to be stationary, axially symmetric (but rotating), and reflection symmetric through an equatorial plane, so its (vacuum) spacetime geometry is fully characterized by two families of scalar multipole moments Ml and Sl with l=0,1,2,3,..., and it is assumed not to absorb any orbital energy (e.g., via waves going down a horizon or via tidal heating). Also for simplicity, the orbit is assumed to lie in the body’s equatorial plane and to be circular, except for a gradual shrinkage due to radiative energy loss. For this idealized situation, it is shown that several features of the emitted waves carry, encoded within themselves, the values of all the body’s multipole moments Ml, Sl (and thus, also the details of its full spacetime geometry). In particular, the body’s moments are encoded in the time evolution of the waves’ phase $\Phi$(t) (the quantity that can be measurd with extremely high accuracy by interferometric gravitational-wave detectors), and they are also encoded in the gravitational-wave spectrum $\Delta$E(f) (energy emitted per unit logarithmic frequency interval). If the orbit is slightly elliptical, the moments are also encoded in the evolution of its periastron precession frequency as a function of wave frequency, $\Omega$$\rho$(f); if the orbit is slightly inclined to the body’s equatorial plane, then they are encoded in its inclinational precession frequency as a function of wave frequency, $\Omega$z(f). Explicit algorithms are derived for deducing the moments from $\Delta$E(f), $\Omega$$\rho$(f), and $\Omega$z(f). However, to deduce the moments explicitly from the (more accurately measurable) phase evolution $\Phi$(t) will require a very difficult, explicit analysis of the wave generation process—a task far beyond the scope of this paper.},

abstract = {Observations indicate that most massive galaxies contain a supermassive black hole, and theoretical studies suggest that when such galaxies have a major merger, the central black holes will form a binary and eventually coalesce. Here we discuss two spectral signatures of such binaries that may help distinguish them from ordinary AGN. These signatures are expected when the mass ratio between the holes is not extreme and the system is fed by a circumbinary disk. One such signature is a notch in the thermal continuum that has been predicted by other authors; we point out that it should be accompanied by a spectral revival at shorter wavelengths and also discuss its dependence on binary properties such as mass, mass ratio, and separation. In particular, we note that the wavelength $\lambda_n$ at which the notch occurs depends on these three parameters in such a way as to make the number of systems displaying these notches $\propto \lambda_n^{16/3}$; longer wavelength searches are therefore strongly favored. A second signature, first discussed here, is hard X-ray emission with a Wien-like spectrum at a characteristic temperature $\sim 100$ keV produced by Compton cooling of the shock generated when streams from the circumbinary disk hit the accretion disks around the individual black holes. We investigate the observability of both signatures. The hard X-ray signal may be particularly valuable as it can provide an indicator of black hole merger a few decades in advance of the event.},

abstract = {We add black holes to nonrotating, spherical galaxy models, with the assumption that the black-hole growth is slow compared with the dynamical time but fast compared with the relaxation time. The outcome differs depending on whether the core of the initial galaxy does or does not resemble that of an isothermal sphere. For the isothermal case the previously-known results are confirmed and sharpened: the black hole induces cusps in the density ($\rho\sim r^{-3/2}$) and velocity dispersion ($v^2\sim r^{-1}$), and a tangential anisotropy in the velocity distribution away from the center. For the non-isothermal case the induced density cusp is steeper, and the induced anisotropy is larger and penetrates right to the center. The cusp around the black hole is insensitive to anisotropy in the initial velocity distribution, and also to the origin of the black hole, unless its mass comes exclusively from the stars of lowest angular momentum, in which case the cusp is suppressed. We discuss the implications for the interpretation of evidence for massive black holes in galactic nuclei.},

The analysis incorporates the two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in energy (E) and angular-momentum (J) space, for which the approximate velocity-diffusion coefficients computed for the case of a Maxwellian field-star distribution are employed. The distribution of the stars as a function of J is determined for small J by considering the rate at which stars of fixed E enter the loss cone; a Fokker-Planck equation in E alone and containing an energy-dependent 'sink' term is obtained by integrating the two-dimensional equation over J and substituting an expression for the stellar consumption rate; and the approximate steady-state solution to this equation in the 'self-similar' regime is found along with the total rate at which the central object consumes stars. The results are applied to a massive black hole at the center of a globular cluster (M15) and an elliptical galaxy.},

abstract = {DECIGO Path Finder (DPF) is a space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detector with sensitivity in the frequency band 0.1--100Hz. As a first step mission to DECIGO, it is aiming for launching in 2016--2017. Although its main objective is to demonstrate technology for GW observation in space, DPF still has a chance of detecting GW signals and performing astrophysical observations. With an observable range up to 50 kpc, its main targets are GW signals from galactic intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) binaries. By using inspiral-merger-ringdown phenomenological waveforms, we perform both pattern-averaged analysis and Monte Carlo simulations including the effect of detector motion to find that the masses and (effective) spins of the IMBHs could be determined with errors of a few percent, should the signals be detected. Since GW signals from IMBH binaries with masses above $10^4 M_\odot$ cannot be detected by ground-based detectors, these objects can be unique sources for DPF. If the inspiral signal of a $10^3M_\odot$ IMBH binary is detected with DPF, it can give alert to the ringdown signal for the ground-based detectors $10^2$--$10^3$s before coalescence. We also estimate the possible bound on the graviton Compton wavelength from a possible IMBH binary in $\omega$ Centauri. We obtain a slightly weaker constraint than the solar system experiment and an about 2 orders of magnitude stronger constraint than the one from binary pulsar tests. Unfortunately, the detection rate of IMBH binaries is rather small.},

abstract = {We lay the foundations for the construction of analytic expressions for Fourier-domain gravitational waveforms produced by eccentric, inspiraling compact binaries in a post-circular or small-eccentricity approximation. The time-dependent, "plus" and "cross" polarizations are expanded in Bessel functions, which are then self-consistently re-expanded in a power series about zero initial eccentricity to eighth order. The stationary phase approximation is then employed to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the Fourier transform of the post-circular expanded, time-domain signal. We exemplify this framework by considering Newtonian-accurate waveforms, which in the post-circular scheme give rise to higher harmonics of the orbital phase and amplitude corrections both to the amplitude and the phase of the Fourier domain waveform. Such higher harmonics lead to an effective increase in the inspiral mass reach of a detector as a function of the binary's eccentricity e_0 at the time when the binary enters the detector sensitivity band. Using the largest initial eccentricity allowed by our approximations (e_0 < 0.4), the mass reach is found to be enhanced up to factors of approximately 5 relative to that of circular binaries for Advanced LIGO, LISA, and the proposed Einstein Telescope at a signal-to-noise ratio of ten. A post-Newtonian generalization of the post circular scheme is also discussed, which holds the promise to provide "ready-to-use" Fourier-domain waveforms for data analysis of eccentric inspirals.},

In this series of papers, we investigate a framework for testing the no-hair theorem with observations of black holes in the electromagnetic spectrum. We formulate our approach in terms of a parametric spacetime which contains a quadrupole moment that is independent of both mass and spin. If the no-hair theorem is correct, then any deviation of the black hole quadrupole moment from its Kerr value has to be zero. We analyze in detail the properties of this quasi-Kerr spacetime that are critical to interpreting observations of black holes and demonstrate their dependence on the spin and quadrupole moment. In particular, we show that the location of the innermost stable circular orbit and the gravitational lensing experienced by photons are affected significantly at even modest deviations of the quadrupole moment from the value predicted by the no-hair theorem. We argue that observations of black hole images, of relativistically broadened iron lines, as well as of thermal X-ray spectra from accreting black holes will lead in the near future to an experimental test of the no-hair theorem.},

abstract = {The mathematical simplicity of black holes, combined with their links to some of the most energetic events in the universe, means that black holes are key objects for fundamental physics and astrophysics. Until recently, it was generally believed that black holes in nature appear in two broad mass ranges: stellar-mass (M$\sim$3–20 M⊙), which are produced by the core collapse of massive stars, and supermassive (M$\sim$106–1010 M⊙), which are found in the centers of galaxies and are produced by a still uncertain combination of processes. In the last few years, however, evidence has accumulated for an intermediate-mass class of black holes, with M$\sim$102–104 M⊙. If such objects exist they have important implications for the dynamics of stellar clusters, the formation of supermassive black holes, and the production and detection of gravitational waves. We review the evidence for intermediate-mass black holes and discuss future observational and theoretical work that will help clarify numerous outstanding questions about t...},

These data allow us to determine the rotation curve of the inner $\sim$1" of the ionized gas disk in [O II] lambda 3727 to a distance as close as 0."07 ($\sim$=5 pc) to the dynamic center, thereby significantly improving on both the spatial resolution and coverage of previous FOS observations. We have modeled the kinematics of the gas under the assumption of the existence of both a central black hole and an extended central mass distribution, taking into account the effects of the instrumental PSF, the intrinsic luminosity distribution of the line, and the finite size of the slit. We find that the central mass must be concentrated within a sphere whose maximum radius is 0."05 ($\sim$=3.5 pc) and show that both the observed rotation curve and line profiles are consistent with a thin disk in Keplerian motion. We conclude that the most likely explanation for the observed motions is the presence of a supermassive black hole and derive a value of MBH = (3.2 +/- 0.9) x 109 M⊙ for its mass.},

abstract = {With the advent of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a millimeter/sub-millimeter very-long baseline interferometer (VLBI), it has become possible to image a handful of black holes with sub-horizon resolutions. However, these images do not translate into microarcsecond absolute positions due to the lack of absolute phase information when an external phase reference is not used. Due to the short atmospheric coherence time at these wavelengths, nodding between the source and phase reference is impractical. However, here we suggest an alternative scheme which makes use of the fact that many of the VLBI stations within the EHT are arrays in their own right. With this we show that it should be possible to absolutely position the supermassive black holes at the centers of the Milky Way (Sgr A*) and M87 relative to nearby objects with precisions of roughly 1 microarcsecond. This is sufficient to detect the perturbations to Sgr A*'s position resulting from interactions with the stars and stellar-mass black holes in the Galactic cusp on year timescales, and severely constrain the astrophysically relevant parameter space for an orbiting intermediate mass black hole, implicated in some mechanisms for producing the young massive stars in the Galactic center. For M87, it allows the registering of millimeter images, in which the black hole may be identified by its silhouette against nearby emission, and existing larger scale radio images, eliminating present ambiguities in the nature of the radio core and inclination, opening angle, and source of the radio jet.},

abstract = {We present a method for extracting actions, angles and frequencies from an orbit's time series. The method recovers the generating function that maps an analytic phase-space torus to the torus to which the orbit is confined by simultaneously solving the constraints provided by each time step. We test the method by recovering the actions and frequencies of a triaxial St\"ackel potential, and use it to investigate the structure of orbits in a triaxial potential that has been fitted to our Galaxy's Sagittarius stream. The method promises to be useful for analysing N-body simulations. It also takes a step towards constructing distribution functions for the triaxial components of our Galaxy, such as the bar and dark halo.},

abstract = {No more salient issue exists in contemporary astrophysics and cosmology than that of the elusive "dark matter". For many years already Milgrom's paradigm of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) has provided an alternative way to interpret observations without appeal to invisible dark matter. MOND had been successful in elucidating economically the dynamics of disk galaxies of all scales, while doing less well for clusters of galaxies; in its original form it could not address gravitational lensing or cosmology. After reviewing some of the evidence in favor of MOND, I recollect the development of relativistic formulations for it to cope with the last deficiency. I comment on recent work by various groups in confronting TeVeS, a relativistic embodiment of MOND, with observational data on gravitational lensing and cosmology. Throughout I ask what sort of physics can be responsible for the efficacy of MOND, and conclude with an appraisal of what theoretical developments are still needed to reach a full description of the world involving no unobserved matter.},

The probability of transformations of gravitons into photons in presence of cosmological background magnetic field is calculated at the recombination epoch and during subsequent cosmological stages.

It is shown that if the early Universe was dominated by primordial black holes (PBHs) prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the relic gravitons emitted by PBHs would transform to an almost isotropic background of electromagnetic radiation due to conversion of gravitons into photons in cosmological magnetic fields.

Here we show that obtained results of the asymptotic behavior of hybrid action, are in more accordance with observation against the other modifications such as power law and logarithmic corrections Iorio (2008).

The existence of a central black hole is additionally remarkable in that NGC 1042 lacks a stellar bulge.

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that ground-based gravitational wave (GW) instruments will not be sensitive to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) because the characteristic GW frequencies are far below the $\sim$ 10 - 1000 Hz sensitivity bands of terrestrial detectors. Here, however, we explore the possibility of SMBH gravitational waves to leak to higher frequencies. In particular, if the high frequency spectral tail asymptotes to h(f) $\sim$ f^(-alpha), where alpha<=2, then the spectral amplitude is a constant or increasing function of the mass M at a fixed frequency f>>c^3/GM. This will happen if the time domain waveform or its derivative exhibits a discontinuity. Ground based instruments could search for these universal spectral tails to detect or rule out such features irrespective of their origin. We identify the following processes which may generate high frequency signals: (i) gravitational bremsstrahlung of ultrarelativistic objects in the vicinity of a SMBH, (ii) ringdown modes excited by an external process that has a high frequency component or terminates abruptly, (iii) gravitational lensing echos and diffraction. More specifically for (iii), SMBHs produce GW echos of inspiraling stellar mass binaries in galactic nuclei with a delay of a few minutes to hours. We estimate the order of magnitude of the detection signal to noise ratio for each mechanism (i, ii, and iii) as a function of the waveform parameters.},

abstract = {The most promising astrophysical sources of kHz gravitational waves (GWs) are the inspiral and merger of binary neutron star(NS)/black hole systems. Maximizing the scientific return of a GW detection will require identifying a coincident electro-magnetic (EM) counterpart. One of the most likely sources of isotropic EM emission from compact object mergers is a supernova-like transient powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in ejecta from the merger. We present the first calculations of the optical transients from compact object mergers that self-consistently determine the radioactive heating by means of a nuclear reaction network; using this heating rate, we model the light curve with a one dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculation. For an ejecta mass $\sim$1e-2 M_sun[1e-3 M_sun] the resulting light curve peaks on a timescale $\sim$ 1 day at a V-band luminosity nu L_nu $\sim$ 3e41[1e41] ergs/s (M_V = -15[-14]); this corresponds to an effective "f" parameter $\sim$3e-6 in the Li-Paczynski toy model. We argue that these results are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in the relevant nuclear physics and to the precise early-time dynamics and ejecta composition. Due to the rapid evolution and low luminosity of NS merger transients, EM counterpart searches triggered by GW detections will require close collaboration between the GW and astronomical communities. NS merger transients may also be detectable following a short-duration Gamma-Ray Burst or "blindly" with present or upcoming optical transient surveys. Because the emission produced by NS merger ejecta is powered by the formation of rare r-process elements, current optical transient surveys can directly constrain the unknown origin of the heaviest elements in the Universe.},

The data from these instruments will provide a unique perspective on extreme astrophysical objects, such as neutron stars and black holes, and will allow us to test Einstein's theory of gravity in the strong field, dynamical regime. To fully realize these goals, we need to solve some challenging problems in signal processing and inference, such as finding rare and weak signals that are buried in non-stationary and non-Gaussian instrument noise, dealing with high-dimensional model spaces, and locating what are often extremely tight concentrations of posterior mass within the prior volume. Gravitational wave detection using space-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays bring with them the additional challenge of having to isolate individual signals that overlap one another in both time and frequency. Promising solutions to these problems will be discussed, along with some of the challenges that remain.},

abstract = {We present significantly improved proper motion measurements of the Milky Way's central stellar cluster. These improvements are made possible by refining our astrometric reference frame with a new geometric optical distortion model for the W. M. Keck II 10 m telescope's Adaptive Optics camera (NIRC2) in its narrow field mode. For the first time, this distortion model is constructed from on-sky measurements, and is made available to the public. When applied to widely dithered images, it produces residuals in the separations of stars that are a factor of $\sim$3 smaller compared to the outcome using previous models. By applying this new model, along with corrections for differential atmospheric refraction, to widely dithered images of SiO masers at the Galactic center, we improve our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio Sgr A*-rest frame. The resulting infrared reference frame is $\sim$2-3 times more accurate and stable than earlier published efforts. In this reference frame, Sgr A* is localized to within a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas/yr, or $\sim$3.4 km/s at 8 kpc (1 sigma). While earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame by assuming no net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentally limited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not improve with time. We define a reference frame with SiO masers and this reference frame's stability should improve steadily with future measurements of the SiO masers in this region. This is essential for achieving the necessary reference frame stability required to detect the effects of general relativity and extended mass on short-period stars at the Galactic center.},

abstract = {Gravitational Wave (GW) observations of coalescing compact binaries will be unique probes of strong-field, dynamical aspects of relativistic gravity. We present a short review of various schemes proposed in the literature to test General Relativity (GR) and alternative theories of gravity using inspiral waveforms. Broadly these schemes may be classified into two types: model dependent and model independent. In the model dependent category, GW observations are compared against a specific waveform model representative of a particular theory or a class of theories like Scalar-Tensor theories, Dynamical Chern-Simons theory and Massive graviton theories. Model independent tests are attempts to write down a parametrised gravitational waveform where the free parameters take different values for different theories and (at least some of) which can be constrained by GW observations. We revisit some of the proposed bounds in the case of downscaled LISA configuration (eLISA) and compare them with the original LISA configuration. We also compare the expected bounds on alternative theories of gravity from ground-based and space-based detectors and find that space-based GW detectors can test GR and other theories of gravity with unprecedented accuracies. We then focus on a recent proposal to use singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Fisher information matrix to improve the accuracies with which Post-Newtonian (PN) theory can be tested. We extend those results to the case of space based detector eLISA and discuss its implications.},

In particular we will compare the O star spectroscopic binary fraction in nearby open clusters and we will show that the current data are adequately described by an homogeneous fraction of f $\sim$ 0.44.  We will also summarize our current understanding of the observed parameter distributions of O + OB spectroscopic binaries. We will show that the period distribution is overabundant in short period binaries and that it can be described by a bi-modal \"{O}pik law with a break point around P $\sim$ 10 d.

abstract = {Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, in which a stellar-mass compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole, are prime candidates for detection with space-borne milliHertz gravitational wave detectors, similar to the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. The gravitational waves generated during such inspirals encode information about the background in which the small object is moving, providing a tracer of the spacetime geometry and a probe of strong-field physics. In this paper, we construct approximate, "analytic-kludge" waveforms for such inspirals with parameterized post-Einsteinian corrections that allow for generic, model-independent deformations of the supermassive black hole background away from the Kerr metric. These approximate waveforms include all of the qualitative features of true waveforms for generic inspirals, including orbital eccentricity and relativistic precession. The deformations of the Kerr metric are modeled using a recently proposed, modified gravity bumpy metric, which parametrically deforms the Kerr spacetime while ensuring that three approximate constants of the motion remain for geodesic orbits: a conserved energy, azimuthal angular momentum and Carter constant. The deformations represent modified gravity effects and have been analytically mapped to several modified gravity black hole solutions in four dimensions. In the analytic kludge waveforms, the conservative motion is modeled by a post-Newtonian expansion of the geodesic equations in the deformed spacetimes, which in turn induce modifications to the radiation-reaction force. These analytic-kludge waveforms serve as a first step toward complete and model-independent tests of General Relativity with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.},

Here we discuss these sources from the perspectives of astrophysics, data analysis and applications to testing general relativity, providing both a description of the current state of knowledge and an outline of some of the outstanding questions that still need to be addressed.

abstract = {A supermassive black hole can disrupt a star when its tidal field exceeds the star's self-gravity, and can directly capture stars that cross its event horizon. For black holes with mass M > 10^7 solar masses, tidal disruption of main-sequence stars occurs close enough to the event horizon that a Newtonian treatment of the tidal field is no longer valid. The fraction of stars that are directly captured is also no longer negligible. We calculate generically oriented stellar orbits in the Kerr metric, and evaluate the relativistic tidal tensor at pericenter for those stars not directly captured by the black hole. We combine this relativistic analysis with previous calculations of how these orbits are populated to determine tidal-disruption rates for spinning black holes. We find, consistent with previous results, that black-hole spin increases the upper limit on the mass of a black hole capable of tidally disrupting solar-like stars to $\sim$7 x 10^8 solar masses. More quantitatively, we find that direct stellar capture reduces tidal-disruption rates by a factor 2/3 (1/10) at M = 10^7 (10^8) solar masses. The strong dependence of tidal-disruption rates on black-hole spin for M > 10^8 solar masses implies that future surveys like LSST that discover thousands of tidal disruption events can constrain supermassive black-hole spin demographics.},

One complicating factor is the presence of perturbations from other stars, which may induce orbital precession of the same order of magnitude as that due to general relativistic effects. The expected number of stars in this region is small enough that full N-body simulations can be carried out. We present the results of a comprehensive set of such simulations, which include a post-Newtonian treatment of spin-orbit effects. A number of possible models for the distribution of stars and stellar remnants are considered. We find that stellar perturbations are likely to obscure the signal due to frame-dragging for stars beyond $\sim$0.5 mpc from the black hole, while measurement of the quadrupole moment is likely to require observation of stars inside $\sim$0.2 mpc. A high fraction of stellar remnants, e.g. 10-Solar-mass black holes, in this region would make tests of GR problematic at all radii. We discuss the possibility of separating the effects of stellar perturbations from those due to GR.},

abstract = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are the products of frequent galaxy mergers. The coalescence of the SMBHBs is a distinct source of gravitational wave (GW) radiation. The detections of the strong GW radiation and their possible electromagnetic counterparts are essential. Numerical relativity suggests that the post-merger supermassive black hole (SMBH) gets a kick velocity up to 4000 km/s due to the anisotropic GW radiations. Here we investigate the dynamical co-evolution and interaction of the recoiling SMBHs and their galactic stellar environments with one million direct N-body simulations including the stellar tidal disruption by the recoiling SMBHs. Our results show that the accretion of disrupted stars does not significantly affect the SMBH dynamical evolution. We investigate the stellar tidal disruption rates as a function of the dynamical evolution of oscillating SMBHs in the galactic nuclei. Our simulations show that most of stellar tidal disruptions are contributed by the unbound stars and occur when the oscillating SMBHs pass through the galactic center. The averaged disruption rate is $\sim$10^{-6} M_\odot yr^{-1}, which is about an order of magnitude lower than that by a stationary SMBH at similar galactic nuclei. Our results also show that a bound star cluster is around the oscillating SMBH of about $\sim$ 0.7% the black hole mass. In addition, we discover a massive cloud of unbound stars following the oscillating SMBH. We also investigate the dependence of the results on the SMBH masses and density slopes of the galactic nuclei.},

abstract = {Gravitational waveforms from the inspiral and ring-down stages of the binary black hole coalescences can be modelled accurately by approximation/perturbation techniques in general relativity. Recent progress in numerical relativity has enabled us to model also the non-perturbative merger phase of the binary black-hole coalescence problem. This enables us to \emph{coherently} search for all three stages of the coalescence of non-spinning binary black holes using a single template bank. Taking our motivation from these results, we propose a family of template waveforms which can model the inspiral, merger, and ring-down stages of the coalescence of non-spinning binary black holes that follow quasi-circular inspiral. This two-dimensional template family is explicitly parametrized by the physical parameters of the binary. We show that the template family is not only \emph{effectual} in detecting the signals from black hole coalescences, but also \emph{faithful} in estimating the parameters of the binary. We compare the sensitivity of a search (in the context of different ground-based interferometers) using all three stages of the black hole coalescence with other template-based searches which look for individual stages separately. We find that the proposed search is significantly more sensitive than other template-based searches for a substantial mass-range, potentially bringing about remarkable improvement in the event-rate of ground-based interferometers. As part of this work, we also prescribe a general procedure to construct interpolated template banks using non-spinning black hole waveforms produced by numerical relativity.},

The Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) proposal aims at solving the problem by postulating that Newton's second law of motion is modified for accelerations smaller than $\sim$10^{-10}m/s^2. This simple amendment, has had tremendous success in explaining galactic rotation curves. However, being non-relativistic, it cannot make firm predictions for cosmology. A relativistic theory called Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) has been proposed by Bekenstein building on earlier work of Sanders which has a MOND limit for non-relativistic systems. In this article I give a short introduction to TeVeS theory and focus on its predictions for cosmology as well as some non-cosmological studies.},

abstract = {Supermassive black holes can capture or disrupt stars that come sufficiently close. This article reviews the dynamical processes by which stars or stellar remnants are placed onto loss-cone orbits and the implications for feeding rates. The capture rate is well defined for spherical galaxies with nuclear relaxation times that are shorter than the galaxy's age. However, even the dense nucleus of the Milky Way may be less than one relaxation time old, and this is certainly the case for more massive galaxies; the capture rate in such galaxies is an initial-value problem with poorly-known initial conditions and the rate can be much higher, or much lower, than the rate in a collisionally relaxed nucleus. In nonspherical (axisymmetric, triaxial) galaxies, torquing of orbits by the mean field can dominant perturbations due to random encounters, leading to much higher capture rates than in the spherical geometry, particularly in (massive) galaxies with long central relaxation times. Relativistic precession plays a crucial role in mediating the capture of compact remnants from regions very near to the black hole, by destroying the orbital correlations that would otherwise dominate the torques. The complex dynamics of relativistic loss cones are not yet well enough understood for accurate estimates of compact-object (EMRI) capture rates to be made.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the observed broad iron line feature and putative warm absorber in the long 2001 XMM-Newton observation of the Seyfert 1.2 galaxy MCG -06-30-15. The new kerrdisk model we have designed for simulating line emission from accretion disk systems allows black hole spin to be a free parameter in the fit, enabling the user to formally constrain the angular momentum of a black hole, among other physical parameters of the system. In an important extension of previous work, we derive constraints on the black hole spin in MCG -06-30-15 using a self-consistent model for X-ray reflection from the surface of the accretion disk while simultaneously accounting for absorption by dusty photoionized material along the line of sight (the warm absorber). Even including these complications, the XMM-Newton EPIC pn data require extreme relativistic broadening of the X-ray reflection spectrum; assuming no emission from within the radius of marginal stability, we derive a formal constraint on the dimensionless black hole spin parameter of a=0.989+0.009-0.002 at 90% confidence. The principal unmodeled effect that can significantly reduce the inferred black hole spin is powerful emission from within the radius of marginal stability. Although significant theoretical developments are required to fully understand this region, we argue that the need for a rapidly spinning black hole is robust to physically plausible levels of emission from within the radius of marginal stability. In particular, we show that a nonrotating black hole is strongly ruled out.},

The latter is particularly relevant when it drives the binaries to extreme eccentricities (e>0.9), which might be the case for stellar-driven systems. This causes a substantial suppression of the low frequency signal, potentially posing a serious threat to the effectiveness of PTA observations.

abstract = {The compact remnants of core-collapse supernovae-neutron stars and black holes-have properties that reflect both the structure of their stellar progenitors and the physics of the explosion. In particular, the masses of these remnants are sensitive to the density structure of the presupernova star and to the explosion energy. To a considerable extent, the final mass is determined by the ``fallback,'' during the explosion, of matter that initially moves outward, yet ultimately fails to escape. We consider here the simulated explosion of a large number of massive stars (9-100 Msolar) of Population I (solar metallicity) and III (zero metallicity) and find systematic differences in the remnant mass distributions. As pointed out by Chevalier, supernovae in more compact progenitor stars have stronger reverse shocks and experience more fallback. For Population III stars above about 25 Msolar and explosion energies less than 1.5×1051 ergs, black holes are a common outcome, with masses that increase with increasing main-sequence mass up to a maximum hole mass, for very low explosion energy, of about 40 Msolar. If such stars produce primary nitrogen, however, their black holes are systematically smaller. For modern supernovae with nearly solar metallicity, black hole production is much less frequent and the typical masses, which depend sensitively on explosion energy, are smaller. The maximum black hole mass is about 15 Msolar. We explore the neutron star initial mass function for both populations and, for reasonable assumptions about the initial mass cut of the explosion, find good agreement with the average of observed masses of neutron stars in binaries. We also find evidence for a bimodal distribution of neutron star masses with a spike around 1.2 Msolar (gravitational mass) and a broader distribution peaked around 1.4 Msolar.},

abstract = {Measurements of gravitational waves from the inspiral of a stellar-mass compact object into a massive black hole (MBH) are unique probes to test General Relativity (GR) and MBH properties, as well as the stellar distribution about these holes in galactic nuclei. Current data analysis techniques can provide us with parameter estimation with very narrow errors. However, an EMRI is not a two-body problem, since other stellar bodies orbiting nearby will influence the capture orbit. Any deviation from the isolated inspiral of the binary will induce a small, though observable deviation from the idealised waveform which could be misinterpreted as a failure of GR. Based on conservative analysis of mass segregation in a Milky Way like nucleus, we estimate that the possibility that a star has a semi-major axis comparable to that of the EMRI is non-negligible. This star introduces an observable perturbation in the orbit in the case in which we consider only loss of energy via gravitational radiation at periapsis. When considering the two first-order non-dissipative post-Newtonian contributions (the periapsis shift of the orbit) the evolution of the orbital elements of the EMRI turns out to be chaotic in nature. The implications of this study are twofold. From the one side, the application to testing GR and measuring MBHs parameters with the detection of EMRIs in galactic nuclei with a millihertz mission will be even more challenging than believed. From the other side, this behaviour could in principle be used as a signature of mass segregation in galactic nuclei.},

abstract = {We study for the first time a 3-dimensional octahedron constellation for a space-based gravitational wave detector, which we call OGO: the Octahedral Gravitational Observatory. With six spacecraft the constellation is able to remove laser frequency noise and acceleration disturbances from the gravitational wave signal without needing LISA-like drag-free control, thereby simplifying the payloads and placing less stringent demands on the thrusters. We generalize LISA's time-delay interferometry (TDI) to displacement-noise free interferometry (DFI) by deriving a set of generators for those combinations of the data streams which cancel laser and acceleration noise. Orbit dynamical considerations suggest a halo orbit near the Lagrangian point L1, allowing only relatively short arms. For these orbits, we derive the sensitivity curve of this detector concept, which has a peak sensitivity near 100 Hz. We compare this version of OGO to the present generation of ground-based detectors and to some future detectors. Since the sensitivity of OGO is limited mainly by shot noise, we discuss how the overall sensitivity could be improved by using advanced technologies that reduce just this noise source. We also investigate the scientific potentials of such a detector, which include observing gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences, the stochastic background and pulsars as well as the possibility to test alternative theories of gravity. Finding alternative orbits that allow longer arms for the octahedron constellation might further improve its sensitivity and science output.},

abstract = {The high precision of the latest version of the planetary ephemeris Ephemerides of the Planets and the Moon (EPM2011) enables one to explore more accurately a variety of small effects in the Solar system. The processing of about 678 thousand of position observations of planets and spacecraft for 1913-2011 with the predominance of modern radar measurements resulted in improving the PPN parameters, dynamic oblateness of the Sun, secular variation of the heliocentric gravitational constant G M⊙, and the stronger limits on variation of the gravitational constant G. This processing made it possible to estimate the potential additional gravitational influence of dark matter on the motion of the Solar system bodies. The density of dark matter $\rho$dm, if any, turned out to be substantially below the accuracy achieved by the present determination of such parameters. At the distance of the orbit of Saturn the density $\rho$dm is estimated to be under 1.1 × 10-20 g cm-3, and the mass of dark matter in the area inside the orbit of Saturn is less than 7.9 × 10-11 M⊙ even taking into account its possible tendency to concentrate in the centre.},

abstract = {We explore the properties of test-particle orbits in "bumpy" spacetimes - stationary, reflection-symmetric, asymptotically flat solutions of Einstein equations that have a non-Kerr (anomalous) higher-order multipole-moment structure but can be tuned arbitrarily close to the Kerr metric. Future detectors should observe gravitational waves generated during inspirals of compact objects into supermassive central bodies. If the central body deviates from the Kerr metric, this will manifest itself in the emitted waves. Here, we explore some of the features of orbits in non-Kerr spacetimes that might lead to observable signatures. As a basis for this analysis, we use a family of exact solutions proposed by Manko & Novikov which deviate from the Kerr metric in the quadrupole and higher moments, but we also compare our results to other work in the literature. We examine isolating integrals of the orbits and find that the majority of geodesic orbits have an approximate fourth constant of the motion (in addition to the energy, angular momentum and rest mass) and the resulting orbits are tri-periodic to high precision. We also find that this fourth integral can be lost for certain orbits in some oblately deformed Manko-Novikov spacetimes. However, compact objects will probably not end up on these chaotic orbits in nature. We compute the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and find that the behavior of orbtis near the ISCO can be qualitatively different depending on whether the ISCO is determined by the onset of an instability in the radial or vertical direction. Finally, we compute periapsis and orbital-plane precessions for nearly circular and nearly equatorial orbits in both the strong and weak field, and discuss weak-field precessions for eccentric equatorial orbits.},

@article{Miller2012,
abstract = {Massive black holes have been discovered in all closely examined galaxies with high velocity dispersion. The case is not as clear for lower-dispersion systems such as low-mass galaxies and globular clusters. Here we suggest that above a critical velocity dispersion of roughly 40 km/s, massive central black holes will form in relaxed stellar systems at any cosmic epoch. This is because above this dispersion primordial binaries cannot support the system against deep core collapse. If, as previous simulations show, the black holes formed in the cluster settle to produce a dense subcluster, then given the extremely high densities reached during core collapse the holes will merge with each other. For low velocity dispersions and hence low cluster escape speeds, mergers will typically kick out all or all but one of the holes due to three-body kicks or the asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. If one hole remains, it will tidally disrupt stars at a high rate. If none remain, one is formed after runaway collisions between stars, then it tidally disrupts stars at a high rate. The accretion rate after disruption is many orders of magnitude above Eddington. If, as several studies suggest, the hole can accept matter at that rate because the generated radiation is trapped and advected, then it will grow quickly and form a massive central black hole.},

@article{Johannsen2013a,
abstract = {In general relativity, all black holes in vacuum are described by the Kerr metric, which has only two independent parameters: the mass and the spin. The unique dependence on these two parameters is known as the no-hair theorem. This theorem may be tested observationally by using electromagnetic or gravitational-wave observations to map the spacetime around a candidate black hole and measure potential deviations from the Kerr metric. Several parametric frameworks have been constructed for tests of the no-hair theorem. Due to the uniqueness of the Kerr metric, any such parametric framework must violate at least one of the assumptions of the no-hair theorem. This can lead to pathologies in the spacetime, such as closed timelike curves or singularities, which may hamper using the metric in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we analyze in detail several parametric frameworks and show explicitly the manner in which they differ from the Kerr metric. We calculate the coordinate locations of event horizons in these metrics, if any exist, using methods adapted from the numerical relativity literature. We identify the regions where each parametric deviation is unphysical as well as the range of coordinates and parameters for which each spacetime remains a regular extension of the Kerr metric and is, therefore, suitable for observational tests of the no-hair theorem.},

@article{Hughes2000,
abstract = {A major focus of much current research in gravitation theory is on understanding how radiation reaction drives the evolution of a binary system, particularly in the extreme mass ratio limit. Such research is of direct relevance to gravitational-wave sources for space-based detectors (such as LISA). We present here a study of the radiative evolution of circular (i.e., constant Boyer-Lindquist coordinate radius), non-equatorial Kerr black hole orbits. Recent theorems have shown that, at least in an adiabatic evolution, such orbits evolve from one circular configuration into another, changing only their radius and inclination angle. This constrains the system's evolution in such a way that the change in its Carter constant can be deduced from knowledge of gravitational wave fluxes propagating to infinity and down the black hole's horizon. Thus, in this particular case, a local radiation reaction force is not needed. In accordance with post-Newtonian weak-field predictions, we find that inclined orbits radiatively evolve to larger inclination angles (although the post-Newtonian prediction overestimates the rate of this evolution in the strong field by a factor <$\sim$3). We also find that the gravitational waveforms emitted by these orbits are rather complicated, particularly when the hole is rapidly spinning, as the radiation is influenced by many harmonics of the orbital frequencies.},

abstract = {The discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe, thought to be driven by a mysterious form of `dark energy' constituting most of the Universe, has further revived the interest in testing Einstein's theory of General Relativity. At the very foundation of Einstein's theory is the geodesic motion of a small, structureless test-particle. Depending on the physical context, a star, planet or satellite can behave very nearly like a test-particle, so geodesic motion is used to calculate the advance of the perihelion of a planet's orbit, the dynamics of a binary pulsar system and of an Earth orbiting satellite. Verifying geodesic motion is then a test of paramount importance to General Relativity and other theories of fundamental physics. On the basis of the first few months of observations of the recently launched satellite LARES, its orbit shows the best agreement of any satellite with the test-particle motion predicted by General Relativity. That is, after modelling its known non-gravitational perturbations, the LARES orbit shows the smallest deviations from geodesic motion of any artificial satellite. LARES-type satellites can thus be used for accurate measurements and for tests of gravitational and fundamental physics. Already with only a few months of observation, LARES provides smaller scatter in the determination of several low-degree geopotential coefficients (Earth gravitational deviations from sphericity) than available from observations of any other satellite or combination of satellites.},

This would be the first type 2 AGN reported with strong red Fe Ka wing detected which demands a fast rotating SMBH. The unusually large EW would suggest that the light bending effect is strong in this source. Alternatively, the spectra could be fitted by a dual absorber model (though with a global chi^2 higher by $\sim$ 6 for 283 d.o.f) with N_H1 = 7.0 x 10^22 cm^-2 covering 100% of the X-ray source, and N_H2 = 21.7 x 10^22 cm^-2 covering 71%, which does not require an extra broad Fe Ka line.},

Detailed expressions are derived for the relevant diffusion coefficients, the time-dependent Boltzmann equation is solved numerically, and solutions are found which satisfy the boundary conditions at both zero and large binding energy. The results indicate that the distribution function is approximately a power law throughout most of the black hole's gravitational well, that stars in bound orbits diffuse slowly down the gravitational well under equilibrium conditions, and that a black hole of less than or approximately 1000 solar masses may accrete stars primarily by capture from unbound orbits. Several methods for detecting massive black holes in cores of globular clusters are discussed along with expected large statistical fluctuations close to the black hole and the possible relevance of various stellar accretion processes for globular-cluster X-ray sources.},

In these theories, modifications of the gravitational radiation damping formulae or of the propagation of the waves translate into a change in the phase evolution of the observed gravitational waveform. We obtain the bounds through the technique of matched filtering, employing the LISA Sensitivity Curve Generator (SCG), available online. For a neutron star inspiralling into a 10^3 M_sun black hole in the Virgo Cluster, in a two-year integration, we find a lower bound \omega > 3 * 10^5. For lower-mass black holes, the bound could be as large as 2 * 10^6. The bound is independent of LISA arm length, but is inversely proportional to the LISA position noise error. Lower bounds on the graviton Compton wavelength ranging from 10^15 km to 5 * 10^16 km can be obtained from one-year observations of massive binary black hole inspirals at cosmological distances (3 Gpc), for masses ranging from 10^4 to 10^7 M_sun. For the highest-mass systems (10^7 M_sun), the bound is proportional to (LISA arm length)^{1/2} and to (LISA acceleration noise)^{-1/2}. For the others, the bound is independent of these parameters because of the dominance of white-dwarf confusion noise in the relevant part of the frequency spectrum. These bounds improve and extend earlier work which used analytic formulae for the noise curves.},

abstract = {Black hole event horizons, causally separating the external universe from compact regions of spacetime, are one of the most exotic predictions of general relativity. Until recently, their compact size has prevented efforts to study them directly. Here we show that recent millimeter and infrared observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, all but require the existence of a horizon. Specifically, we show that these observations limit the luminosity of any putative visible compact emitting region to below 0.4% of Sgr A*'s accretion luminosity. Equivalently, this requires the efficiency of converting the gravitational binding energy liberated during accretion into radiation and kinetic outflows to be greater than 99.6%, considerably larger than those implicated in Sgr A*, and therefore inconsistent with the existence of such a visible region. Finally, since we are able to frame this argument entirely in terms of observable quantities, our results apply to all geometric theories of gravity that admit stationary solutions, including the commonly discussed f ( R ) class of theories.},

abstract = {Dynamical friction leads to an orbital decay of massive objects like young compact star clusters or massive black holes in central regions of galaxies. The dynamical friction force can be well approximated by Chandrasekhar's standard formula, but recent investigations show that corrections to the Coulomb logarithm are necessary. With a large set of N-body simulations we show that the improved formula for the Coulomb logarithm fits the orbital decay very well for circular and eccentric orbits. The local scalelength of the background density distribution serves as the maximum impact parameter for a wide range of power-law indices of -1 \ldots -5. For each type of code the numerical resolution must be compared to the effective minimum impact parameter in order to determine the Coulomb logarithm. We also quantify the correction factors by using self-consistent velocity distribution functions instead of the standard Maxwellian often used. These factors enter directly the decay time-scale and cover a range of 0.5 \ldots 3 for typical orbits. The new Coulomb logarithm combined with self-consistent velocity distribution functions in the Chandrasekhar formula provides a significant improvement of orbital decay times with correction up to one order of magnitude compared to the standard case. We suggest the general use of the improved formula in parameter studies as well as in special applications.},

abstract = {We report the results of a first study that uses numerical simulations to estimate the accuracy with which one can use gravitational wave observations of double neutron star inspiral to measure parameters of the neutron-star equation of state. The simulations use the evolution and initial-data codes of Shibata and Uryu to compute the last several orbits and the merger of neutron stars, with matter described by a parametrized equation of state. Previous work suggested the use of an effective cutoff frequency to place constraints on the equation of state. We find, however, that greater accuracy is obtained by measuring departures from the point-particle limit of the gravitational waveform produced during the late inspiral. As the stars approach their final plunge and merger, the gravitational wave phase accumulates more rapidly for smaller values of the neutron star compactness (the ratio of the mass of the neutron star to its radius). We estimate that realistic equations of state will lead to gravitational waveforms that are distinguishable from point particle inspirals at an effective distance (the distance to an optimally oriented and located system that would produce an equivalent waveform amplitude) of 100 Mpc or less. As Lattimer and Prakash observed, neutron-star radius is closely tied to the pressure at density not far above nuclear. Our results suggest that broadband gravitational wave observations at frequencies between 500 and 1000 Hz will constrain this pressure, and we estimate the accuracy with which it can be measured. Related first estimates of radius measurability show that the radius can be determined to an accuracy of $\sim$1 km at 100 Mpc.},

abstract = {A major objective that has been suggested for a follow-on mission to a Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)-type mission is to investigate more completely how intermediate mass black holes were formed and grew in the early universe, before they evolved into the much more massive black holes at the centers of many galaxies today. The actual design of such a follow-on mission will of course depend on what is observed by a LISA-type mission, such as the recently modified proposal for an evolved LISA mission, with the interferometer arm lengths between spacecraft reduced from 5 million to 1 million km. However, the sensitivity goals of a follow-on mission are likely to be influenced strongly by the desire to be able to see mergers of 10 M⊙ black holes with roughly 3000 M⊙ or larger intermediate mass black holes out to as large redshifts as possible. Approximate calculations of the expected signal-to-noise have been made for a possible LISA follow-on mission that was suggested about eight years ago (Bender and Begelman 2005 Trends in Space Science and Cosmic Vision 2020 (Noordwijk: ESA Publications Division) pp 33–38), and was called the Advanced Laser Interferometer Antenna. Based on the calculations, it appears that detections out to a redshift of 10 would be possible for 10 M⊙ black holes spiraling into perhaps 5000 M⊙ or larger intermediate mass black holes if the extragalactic gravitational wave background due to close white dwarf binaries is in the currently estimated range.},

abstract = {We derive the effects of a non-zero cosmological constant $\Lambda$ on gravitational wave propagation in the linearized approximation of general relativity. In this approximation we consider the situation where the metric can be written as $g_{\mu\nu}= \eta_{\mu\nu}+ h_{\mu\nu}^\Lambda + h_{\mu\nu}^W$, $h_{\mu\nu}^{\Lambda,W}<< 1$, where $h_{\mu\nu}^{\Lambda}$ is the background perturbation and $h_{\mu\nu}^{W}$ is a modification interpretable as a gravitational wave. For $\Lambda \neq 0$ this linearization of Einstein equations is self-consistent only in certain coordinate systems. The cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinates do not belong to this class and the derived linearized solutions have to be reinterpreted in a coordinate system that is homogeneous and isotropic to make contact with observations. Plane waves in the linear theory acquire modifications of order $\sqrt{\Lambda}$, both in the amplitude and the phase, when considered in FRW coordinates. In the linearization process for $h_{\mu\nu}$, we have also included terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda h_{\mu\nu})$. For the background perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}^\Lambda$ the difference is very small but when the term $h_{\mu\nu}^{W}\Lambda$ is retained the equations of motion can be interpreted as describing massive spin-2 particles. However, the extra degrees of freedom can be approximately gauged away, coupling to matter sources with a strength proportional to the cosmological constant itself. Finally we discuss the viability of detecting the modifications caused by the cosmological constant on the amplitude and phase of gravitational waves. In some cases the distortion with respect to gravitational waves propagating in Minkowski space-time is considerable. The effect of $\Lambda$ could have a detectable impact on pulsar timing arrays.},

abstract = {Mass loss is a key process in the evolution of massive stars, and must be understood quantitatively to be successfully included in broader astrophysical applications. In this review, we discuss various aspects of radiation driven mass loss, both from the theoretical and the observational side. We focus on winds from OB-stars, with some excursions to the Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf- Rayet stars, A-supergiants and Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae. After reca- pitulating the 1-D, stationary standard model of line-driven wind, extensions accounting for rotation and magnetic fields are discussed. The relevance of the so-called bi-stability jump is outlined. We summarize diagnostical methods to infer wind properties from observations, and compare the results with theore- tical predictions, featuring the massloss-metallicity dependence. Subsequently, we concentrate on two urgent problems which challenge our present understanding of radiation driven winds: weak winds and wind- clumping. We discuss problems of measuring mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of NIR- spectroscopy. Wind-clumping has severe implications for the interpretation of observational diagnostics, as derived mass-loss rates can be overestimated by factors of 2 to 10 if clumping is ignored, and we describe ongoing attempts to allow for more uniform results. We point out that independent arguments from stellar evolution favor a moderate reduction of present- day mass-loss rates. We also consider larger scale wind structure, interpreted in terms of co-rotating interacting regions, and complete this review with a discussion of recent progress on the X-ray line emission from massive stars, highlighting as to how far the analysis of such X-ray line emission can give further clues regarding an adequate description of wind clumping.

@article{Amaro-Seoane2012b,
abstract = {One of the main channels of interactions in galactic nuclei between stars and the central massive black hole (MBH) is the gradual inspiral of compact remnants into the MBH due to the emission of gravitational radiation. Previous works about the estimation of how many events space observatories such as LISA will be able to observe during its operational time differ in orders of magnitude, due to the complexity of the problem. Nevertheless, a common result to all investigations is that a plunge is much more likely than a slow adiabatic inspiral, an EMRI. The event rates for plunges are orders of magnitude larger than slow inspirals. On the other hand, nature MBH's are most likely Kerr and the magnitude of the spin has been sized up to be high. We calculate the number of periapsis passages that a compact object set on to an extremely radial orbit goes through before being actually swallowed by the Kerr MBH and we then translate it into an event rate for a LISA-like observatory. We prove that a "plunging" compact object is conceptually indistinguishable from an adiabatic, slow inspiral. This has an important impact on the event rate, enhancing in some cases significantly, depending on the spin of the MBH and the inclination: If the orbit of the EMRI is prograde, the effective size of the MBH becomes smaller the larger the spin is, whilst if retrograde, it becomes bigger. However, this situation is not symmetric, resulting in an effective enhancement of the rates. The effect of vectorial resonant relaxation on the sense of the orbit does not affect the enhancement. The strong dependence on the spin magnitude and orbital orientation of the EMRI on the rates will allow us to study stellar dynamics in a regime which is invisible to photon-based astrophysics.},

abstract = {The disruption of a binary star by a massive black hole (MBH) typically leads to the capture of one component around the MBH and the ejection of its companion at a high velocity, possibly producing a hypervelocity star. The high fraction of observed triples ($\sim10$% for F/G/K stars and $\sim50$% for OB stars) give rise to the possibility of the disruption of triples by a MBH. Here we study this scenario, and use direct $N$-body integrations to follow the orbits of thousands of triples, during and following their disruption by a MBH (of $4\times10^6$ M$_\odot$, similar to the MBH existing in the Galactic Centre; SgrA$^*$). We find that triple disruption can lead to several outcomes and we discuss their relative frequency. Beside the ejection/capture of single stars, similar to the binary disruption case, the outcomes of triple disruption include the ejection of hypervelocity binaries; capture of binaries around the MBH; collisions between two or all of the triple components (with low enough velocities that could lead to their merger); and the capture of two or even three stars at close orbits around the MBH. The orbits of single stars captured in a single disruption event are found to be correlated. The eccentricity of the mutual orbits of captured/ejected binaries is typically excited to higher values. Stellar evolution of captured/ejected binaries may later result in their coalescence/strong interaction and the formation of hypervelocity blue stragglers or merger remnants in orbits around SgrA*. Finally, the capture of binaries close to the MBH can replenish and increase the binary frequency near the MBH, which is otherwise very low.},

Did MBH seeds form with the same efficiency in small proto-galaxies, or did their formation had to await the buildup of substantial galaxies with deeper potential wells?

For a power-law cusp of radius ra, the black hole mass M$\sim$ 106 Msolar, and the fraction of the compact objects $\delta$$\sim$ 0.1, this rate . The function K(p) depends on parameter p determining the cusp profile, and for the standard cusp profiles with p= 1/4, K(p) $\sim$ 2. We estimate the probability Pr of finding of a compact object orbiting around a black hole with the period P in one particular galaxy to be Pr$\sim$ 10-7[(P/103 s)/(M/106 Msolar)]8/3[(M/106 Msolar)/(ra/1 pc)]3/2. The object with the period P$\sim$ 103 s emits gravitational waves with amplitude sufficient to be detected by the LISA-type gravitational wave antenna from the distance $\sim$103 Mpc. Based on estimates of masses of super-massive black holes in nearby galaxies, we speculate that LISA would detect several such events during its mission.},

A simple merger scenario of small galaxies leads to a proportionality relation between the late-time black hole and bulge masses, with intrinsic scatter (in linear scale) increasing along the ridge line of the relation as the square root of the mass. By examining a sample of 86 galaxies with well measured black hole masses, we find that the intrinsic scatter increases with mass more rapidly than expected from the merger-only scenario. We discuss the possibility that the feedback mechanism that operated during galaxy formation involved the presence of a cooling flow.},

abstract = {Rotating deformed neutron stars are important potential sources for groundbased gravitational-wave interferometers such as LIGO, GE0600 and VIRGO. One mechanism that may lead to significant non-asymmetries is the internal magnetic field. It is well known that a magnetic star will not be spherical and, if the magnetic axis is not aligned with the spin axis, the deformation will lead to the emission of gravitational waves. The aim of this paper is to develop a formalism that would allow us to model magnetically deformed stars, using both realistic equations of state and field configurations. As a first step, we consider a set of simplified model problems. Focusing on dipolar fields, we determine the internal magnetic field which is consistent with a given neutron star model. We then calculate the associated deformation. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our results for current gravitational-wave detectors and future prospects.},

abstract = {A framework is developed which quantifies the local exchange of energy and momentum between matter and the linearised gravitational field. We derive the unique gravitational energy-momentum tensor consistent with this description, and find that this tensor only exists in the harmonic gauge. Consequently, nearly all the gauge freedom of our framework is naturally and unavoidably removed. The gravitational energy-momentum tensor is then shown to have two exceptional properties: (a) it is gauge-invariant for gravitational plane-waves, (b) for arbitrary transverse-traceless fields, the energy-density is never negative, and the energy-flux is never spacelike. We analyse in detail the local gauge invariant energy-momentum transferred between the gravitational field and an infinitesimal point-source, and show that these invariants depend only on the transverse-traceless components of the field. As a result, we are led to a natural gauge-fixing program which at last renders the energy-momentum of the linear gravitational field completely unambiguous, and additionally ensures that gravitational energy is never negative nor flows faster than light. Finally, we calculate the energy-momentum content of gravitational plane-waves, the linearised Schwarzschild spacetime (extending to arbitrary static linear spacetimes) and the gravitational radiation outside two compact sources: a vibrating rod, and an equal-mass binary.},

Generically, each orbit also has associated with it three frequencies, related to the radial, longitudinal and (mean) azimuthal motions. Here we note the curious fact that these two ways of characterizing bound geodesics are not in a one-to-one correspondence. While the former uniquely specifies an orbit up to initial conditions, the latter does not: there is a (strong-field) region of the parameter space in which pairs of physically distinct orbits can have the same three frequencies. In each such isofrequency pair the two orbits exhibit the same rate of periastron precession and the same rate of Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane, and (in a certain sense) they remain "synchronized" in phase.},

The science case for space-based interferometers targeting millihertz sources is very strong. The decade of gravitational-wave discovery is poised to begin.

Such signals could be produced by individual supermassive binary black hole systems in the early stage of coalescence. We phase up the pulsar timing array data set to form, for each position on the sky, two data streams that correspond to the two GW polarizations and then carry out an optimal search for GW signals on these data streams. Since no statistically significant GWs were detected, we place upper limits on the intrinsic GW strain amplitude $h_0$ for a range of GW frequencies. For example, at $10^{-8}$ Hz our analysis has excluded with $95\%$ confidence the presence of signals with $h_0\geqslant 1.7\times 10^{-14}$. Our new limits are about a factor of four more stringent than those of Yardley et al. (2010) based on an earlier PPTA data set and a factor of two better than those reported in the recent Arzoumanian et al. (2014) paper. We also present PPTA directional sensitivity curves and find that for the most sensitive region on the sky, the current data set is sensitive to GWs from circular supermassive binary black holes with chirp masses of $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ out to a luminosity distance of about 100 Mpc. Finally, we set an upper limit of $4 \times 10^{-3} {\rm{Mpc}}^{-3} {\rm{Gyr}}^{-1}$ at $95\%$ confidence on the coalescence rate of nearby ($z \lesssim 0.1$) supermassive binary black holes in circular orbits with chirp masses of $10^{10}M_{\odot}$.},

abstract = {Recent millimeter-VLBI observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) have, for the first time, directly probed distances comparable to the horizon scale of a black hole. This provides unprecedented access to the environment immediately around the horizon of an accreting black hole. We leverage both existing spectral and polarization measurements and our present understanding of accretion theory to produce a suite of generic radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models of Sgr A*, which we then fit to these recent millimeter-VLBI observations. We find that if the accretion flow onto Sgr A* is well described by a RIAF model, the orientation and magnitude of the black hole's spin is constrained to a two-dimensional surface in the spin, inclination, position angle parameter space. For each of these we find the likeliest values and their 1-sigma & 2-sigma errors to be a=0(+0.4+0.7), inclination=50(+10+30)(-10-10) degrees, and position angle=-20(+31+107)(-16-29) degrees, when the resulting probability distribution is marginalized over the others. The most probable combination is a=0(+0.2+0.4), inclination=90(-40-50) degrees and position angle=-14(+7+11)(-7-11) degrees, though the uncertainties on these are very strongly correlated, and high probability configurations exist for a variety of inclination angles above 30 degrees and spins below 0.99. Nevertheless, this demonstrates the ability millimeter-VLBI observations, even with only a few stations, to significantly constrain the properties of Sgr A*.},

abstract = {The X-ray spectra of accretion discs of eight stellar-mass black holes have been analyzed to date using the thermal continuum fitting method, and the spectral fits have been used to estimate the spin parameters of the black holes. However, the underlying model used in this method of estimating spin is the general relativistic thin-disc model of Novikov & Thorne, which is only valid for razor-thin discs. We therefore expect errors in the measured values of spin due to inadequacies in the theoretical model. We investigate this issue by computing spectra of numerically calculated models of thin accretion discs around black holes, obtained via three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. We apply the continuum fitting method to these computed spectra to estimate the black hole spins and check how closely the values match the actual spin used in the GRMHD simulations. We find that the error in the dimensionless spin parameter is up to about 0.2 for a non-spinning black hole, depending on the inclination. For black holes with spins of 0.7, 0.9 and 0.98, the errors are up to about 0.1, 0.03 and 0.01 respectively. These errors are comparable to or smaller than those arising from current levels of observational uncertainty. Furthermore, we estimate that the GRMHD simulated discs from which these error estimates are obtained correspond to effective disc luminosities of about 0.4-0.7 Eddington, and that the errors will be smaller for discs with luminosities of 0.3 Eddington or less, which are used in the continuum-fitting method. We thus conclude that use of the Novikov-Thorne thin-disc model does not presently limit the accuracy of the continuum-fitting method of measuring black hole spin.},

Recently the sample of MBHs in CGs with dynamically measured masses has increased, and it has been suggested that these MBH masses (M_BH) deviate from the expected correlations with velocity dispersion (sigma) and mass of the bulge (M_bulge) of the host galaxy: MBHs in CGs appear to be `over-massive'. This discrepancy is more pronounced when considering the M_BH-sigma relation than the M_BH-M_bulge one. We show that this behavior stems from a combination of two natural factors, (i) that CGs experience more mergers involving spheroidal galaxies and their MBHs, and (ii) that such mergers are preferentially gas-poor. We use a combination of analytical and semi-analytical models to investigate the MBH-galaxy co-evolution in different environments and find that the combination of these two factors explains the trends observed in current data-sets.},

abstract = {Accretion disk reflection spectra, including broad iron emission lines, bear the imprints of the strong Doppler shifts and gravitational redshifts close to black holes. The extremity of these shifts depends on the proximity of the innermost stable circular orbit to the black hole, and that orbit is determined by the black hole spin parameter. Modeling relativistic spectral features, then, gives a means of estimating black hole spin. We report on the results of fits made to archival X-ray spectra of stellar-mass black holes and black hole candidates, selected for strong disk reflection features. Following recent work, these spectra were fit with reflection models and disk continuum emission models (where required) in which black hole spin is a free parameter. Although our results must be regarded as preliminary, we find evidence for a broad range of black hole spin parameters in our sample. The black holes with the most relativistic radio jets are found to have high spin parameters, though jets are observed in a black hole with a low spin parameter. For those sources with constrained binary system parameters, we examine the distribution of spin parameters versus black hole mass, binary mass ratio, and orbital period. We discuss the results within the context of black hole creation events, relativistic jet production, and efforts to probe the innermost relativistic regime around black holes.},

abstract = {We present a formalism for analyzing a full-sky temperature and polarization map of the cosmic microwave background. Temperature maps are analyzed by expanding over the set of spherical harmonics to give multipole moments of the two-point correlation function. Polarization, which is described by a second-rank tensor, can be treated analogously by expanding in the appropriate tensor spherical harmonics. We provide expressions for the complete set of temperature and polarization multipole moments for scalar and tensor metric perturbations. Four sets of multipole moments completely describe isotropic temperature and polarization correlations; for scalar metric perturbations one set is identically zero, giving the possibility of a clean determination of the vector and tensor contributions. The variance with which the multipole moments can be measured in idealized experiments is evaluated, including the effects of detector noise, sky coverage, and beam width. Finally, we construct coordinate-independent polarization two-point correlation functions, express them in terms of the multipole moments, and derive small-angle limits.},

abstract = {The Einstein Telescope (ET), a proposed third-generation gravitational wave observatory, would enable tests of the no-hair theorem by looking at the characteristic frequencies and damping times of black hole ringdown signals. In previous work it was shown that with a single $500 - 1000\,M_\odot$ black hole at distance $\lesssim 6$ Gpc (or redshift $z \lesssim 1$), deviations of a few percent in the frequencies and damping times of dominant and sub-dominant modes would be within the range of detectability. Given that such sources may be relatively rare, it is of interest to see how well the no-hair theorem can be tested with events at much larger distances and with smaller signal-to-noise ratios, thus accessing a far bigger volume of space and a larger number of sources. We employ a model selection scheme called TIGER (Test Infrastructure for GEneral Relativity), which was originally developed to test general relativity with weak binary coalescence signals that will be seen in second-generation detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. TIGER is well-suited for the regime of low signal-to-noise ratio, and information from a population of sources can be combined so as to arrive at a stronger test. By performing a range of simulations using the expected noise power spectral density of Einstein Telescope, we show that with TIGER, similar deviations from the no-hair theorem as considered in previous work will be detectable with great confidence using $\mathcal{O}(10)$ sources distributed uniformly in co-moving volume out to 50 Gpc ($z \lesssim 5$).},

abstract = {Recently a class of alternative theories of gravity which goes under the name f ( R ) gravity, has received considerable attention, mainly due to its interesting applications in cosmology. However, the phenomenology of such theories is not only relevant to cosmological scales, especially when it is treated within the framework of the so called Palatini variation, an independent variation with respect to the metric and the connection, which is not considered a priori to be the Levi–Civita connection of the metric. If this connection has its standard geometrical meaning the resulting theory will be a metric-affine theory of gravity, as will be discussed in this talk. The general formalism will be presented and several aspects of the theory will be covered, mainly focusing on the enriched phenomenology that such theories exhibit with respect to General Relativity, relevant not only to large scales (cosmology) but also to small scales (e.g. torsion).},

abstract = {We present new weak-lensing observations of 1E 0657-558 (z=0.296), a unique cluster merger, that enable a direct detection of dark matter, independent of assumptions regarding the nature of the gravitational force law. Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 $\sigma$ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.

abstract = {We explore the ability of future low-frequency gravitational wave detectors to measure the spin of stellar mass and intermediate mass black holes that inspiral onto super-massive Kerr black holes (SMBHs). We develop a kludge waveform model based on the equations of motion derived by Saijo et al. [Phys Rev D 58, 064005, 1998] for spinning BH binaries, augmented with spin-orbit and spin-spin couplings taken from perturbative and post-Newtonian (PN) calculations, and the associated conservative self-force corrections, derived by comparison to PN results. We model the inspiral phase using accurate fluxes which include perturbative corrections for the spin of the inspiralling body, spin-spin couplings and higher-order fits to solutions of the Teukolsky equation. We present results of Monte Carlo simulations of parameter estimation errors and of the model errors that arise when we omit conservative corrections from the waveform template. For a source 5000+10^6 solar mass observed with an SNR of 1000, LISA will be able to determine the two masses to within a fractional error of $\sim$0.001, measure the SMBH spin magnitude, q, and the spin magnitude of the inspiralling BH to 0.0001, 10%, respectively, and determine the location of the source in the sky and the SMBH spin orientation to within 0.0001 steradians. For a 10+10^6 solar mass system observed with SNR of 30, LISA will not be able to determine the spin magnitude of the inspiralling BH, although the measurement of the other waveform parameters is not significantly degraded by the presence of spin. The model errors which arise from ignoring conservative corrections become significant for mass-ratios above 0.0001, but including these corrections up to 2PN order may be sufficient to reduce these systematic errors to an acceptable level.},

The new results are consistent with previous results, but have improved due to reduced noise from the additional integration time, improved knowledge of the instrument performance, and improved data analysis procedures. The improvements are described in detail. The seven-year data set is well fit by a minimal six-parameter flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The parameters for this model, using the WMAP data in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and priors on H 0 from Hubble Space Telescope observations, are $\Omega$ b h 2 = 0.02260 ± 0.00053, $\Omega$ c h 2 = 0.1123 ± 0.0035, $\Omega$ $\Lambda$ = 0.728 +0.015 –0.016 , n s = 0.963 ± 0.012, $\tau$ = 0.087 ± 0.014, and $\sigma$ 8 = 0.809 ± 0.024 (68% CL uncertainties).

The new WMAP data, when combined with smaller angular scale microwave background anisotropy data, result in a 3$\sigma$ detection of the abundance of primordial helium, Y He = 0.326 ± 0.075. When combined with additional external data sets, the WMAP data also yield better determinations of the total mass of neutrinos, ∑ m $\nu$ ≤ 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34 +0.86 –0.88 . The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is now determined to be n s = 0.963 ± 0.012, excluding the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by >3$\sigma$.

To lowest order in the wavelength, we obtain a gauge-invariant linearized equation for gravitational waves which is just a covariant generalization of that for massless spin-2 fields in a flat background space. This wave equation is solved in the WKB approximation to show that gravitational waves travel on null geodesics of the curved background geometry with their amplitude, frequency, and polarization modified by the curvature of space-time in exact analogy to light waves.},

abstract = {A massive black hole (MBH) in a galactic center drives a flow of stars into nearly radial orbits to replace those it destroyed. Stars whose orbits cross the event horizon r S or the tidal disruption radius r t are promptly destroyed in an orbital period P . Stars with orbital periapse r p slightly larger than the sink radius q ≡ max( r S , r t ) may slowly spiral in as a result of dissipative interactions with the MBH, e.g., gravitational wave emission, tidal heating, or accretion disk drag, with observable consequences and implications for the MBH growth rate. Unlike prompt destruction, the in-spiral time is typically ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/Gt.gif] {Gt} P . This time is limited by the same scattering process that initially deflected the star into its eccentric orbit, since it can deflect it again to a wider orbit where dissipation is inefficient. The ratio between slow and prompt event rates is therefore much smaller than that implied by the ratio of cross sections, $\sim$ r p / q , and so only prompt disruption contributes significantly to the mass of the MBH. Conversely, most stars that scatter off the MBH survive the extreme tidal interaction ("tidal scattering"). We derive general expressions for the in-spiral event rate and the mean number of in-spiraling stars, and we show that the survival probability of tidally scattered stars is $\sim$1 and that the number of tidally heated stars ("squeezars") and gravity-wave-emitting stars in the galactic center is $\sim$0.1-1.},

abstract = {We simulate the inner 100 pc of the Milky Way to study the formation and evolution of the population of star clusters and intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). For this study we perform extensive direct N-body simulations of the star clusters that reside in the bulge, and of the inner few tenth of parsecs of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center. In our N-body simulations the dynamical friction of the star cluster in the tidal field of the bulge are taken into account via semianalytic solutions. The N-body calculations are used to calibrate a semianalytic model of the formation and evolution of the bulge. We find that $\sim$10% of the clusters born within $\sim$100 pc of the Galactic center undergo core collapse during their inward migration and form IMBHs via runaway stellar merging. After the clusters dissolve, these IMBHs continue their inward drift, carrying a few of the most massive stars with them. We predict that a region within $\sim$10 pc of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) is populated by $\sim$50 IMBHs of $\sim$1000 Msolar. Several of these are still expected to be accompanied by some of the most massive stars from the star cluster. We also find that within a few milliparsecs of the SMBH there is a steady population of several IMBHs. This population drives the merger rate between IMBHs and the SMBH at a rate of about one per 10 Myr, sufficient to build the accumulated majority of mass of the SMBH. Mergers of IMBHs with SMBHs throughout the universe are detectable by LISA at a rate of about two per week.},

abstract = {We present a unified framework for the study of late time cosmic acceleration. Using methods of effective field theory, we show that existing proposals for late time acceleration can be subsumed in a single framework, rather than many compartmentalized theories. We construct the most general action consistent with symmetry principles, derive the background and perturbation evolution equations, and demonstrate that for special choices of our parameters we can reproduce results already existing in the literature. Lastly, we lay the foundation for future work placing phenomenological constraints on the parameters of the effective theory. Although in this paper we focus on late time acceleration, our construction also generalizes the effective field theory of inflation to the scalar-tensor and multi-field case for perturbatively constructed backgrounds.},

abstract = {The present paper reconsiders the Newtonian limit of models of modified gravity including higher order terms in the scalar curvature in the gravitational action. This was studied using the Palatini variational principle in [Meng X. and Wang P.: Gen. Rel. Grav. {\bf 36}, 1947 (2004)] and [Dom\'inguez A. E. and Barraco D. E.: Phys. Rev. D {\bf 70}, 043505 (2004)] with contradicting results. Here a different approach is used, and problems in the previous attempts are pointed out. It is shown that models with negative powers of the scalar curvature, like the ones used to explain the present accelerated expansion, as well as their generalization which include positive powers, can give the correct Newtonian limit, as long as the coefficients of these powers are reasonably small. Some consequences of the performed analysis seem to raise doubts for the way the Newtonian limit was derived in the purely metric approach of fourth order gravity [Dick R.: Gen. Rel. Grav. {\bf 36}, 217 (2004)]. Finally, we comment on a recent paper [Olmo G. J.: Phys. Rev. D {\bf 72}, 083505 (2005)] in which the problem of the Newtonian limit of both the purely metric and the Palatini formalism is discussed, using the equivalent Brans--Dicke theory, and with which our results partly disagree.},

From these simulations we see that not only can EMRIs be produced during this process, but the dynamics are also quite rich. In particular, most of the EMRIs are produced through a process akin to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism, but with strong effects due to the non-Keplerian stellar potential, general relativity, and non-secular oscillations in the angular momentum on the orbital timescale of the binary SMBH system.},

@article{vanderMarel1998,
abstract = {Axisymmetric dynamical models are constructed for the E3 galaxy M32 to interpret high spatial resolution stellar kinematical data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Models are studied with two-integral, f(E, Lz), phase-space distribution functions and with fully general three-integral distribution functions. The latter are built using an extension of Schwarzschild's approach: individual orbits in the axisymmetric potential are calculated numerically, and populated using nonnegative least-squares fitting so as to reproduce all available kinematical data, including line-of-sight velocity profile shapes. The details of this method are described in companion papers by Rix et al. and Cretton et al. Models are constructed for inclinations i = 90 deg (edge on) and i = 55 deg. No model without a nuclear dark object can fit the combined ground-based and HST data, independent of the dynamical structure of M32. Models with a nuclear dark object of mass M• = 3.4 x 106 M⊙ (with 1 sigma and 3 sigma error bars of 0.7 x 106 M⊙ and 1.6 x 106 M⊙, respectively) do provide an excellent fit. The inclined models provide the best fit, but the inferred M• does not depend sensitively on the assumed inclination. The models that best fit the data are not two-integral models, but like two-integral models they are azimuthally anisotropic. Two-integral models therefore provide useful low-order approximations to the dynamical structure of M32. We use them to show that an extended dark object can fit the data only if its half-mass radius is rh <$\sim$ 0."08 (=0.26 pc), implying a central dark matter density exceeding 1 x 108 M⊙ pc-3. The inferred M• is consistent with that suggested previously by ground-based kinematical data. However, radially anisotropic axisymmetric constant mass-to-light ratio models are now ruled out for the first time, and the limit on the dark matter density implied by the HST data is now stringent enough to rule out most plausible alternatives to a massive black hole. The dynamically inferred M• is identical to that suggested by existing models for HST photometry of M32 that assume adiabatic growth (over a timescale exceeding 106 yr) of a black hole into a preexisting core. The low activity of the nucleus of M32 implies either that only a very small fraction of the gas that is shed by evolving stars is accreted onto the black hole or, alternatively, that accretion proceeds at very low efficiency, e.g., in an advection-dominated mode.},

@article{Iguchi2010,
abstract = {Recent observational results provide possible evidence that binary black holes (BBHs) exist in the center of giant galaxies and may merge to form a supermassive black hole in the process of their evolution. We first detected a periodic flux variation on a cycle of $93\pm1$ days from the 3-mm monitor observations of a giant elliptical galaxy \object{3C 66B} for which an orbital motion with a period of $1.05\pm0.03$ years had been already observed. The detected signal period being shorter than the orbital period can be explained by taking into consideration the Doppler-shifted modulation due to the orbital motion of a BBH. Assuming that the BBH has a circular orbit and that the jet axis is parallel to the binary angular momentum, our observational results demonstrate the presence of a very close BBH that has the binary orbit with an orbital period of $1.05\pm0.03$ years, an orbital radius of $(3.9\pm1.0) \times 10^{-3}$ pc, an orbital separation of $(6.1^{+1.0}_{-0.9}) \times 10^{-3}$ pc, the larger black hole mass of $(1.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2}) \times 10^9$ $M_{\sun}$, and the smaller black hole mass of $(7.0^{+4.7}_{-6.4}) \times 10^8$ $M_{\sun}$. The BBH decay time of $(5.1^{+60.5}_{-2.5})\times 10^2$ years provides evidence for the occurrence of black hole mergers. This Letter will demonstrate the interesting possibility of black hole collisions to form a supermassive black hole in the process of evolution, one of the most spectacular natural phenomena in the universe.},

@article{Berti2008,
abstract = {Using recent results from numerical relativity simulations of black hole mergers, we revisit previous studies of cosmological black hole spin evolution. We show that mergers are very unlikely to yield large spins, unless alignment of the spins of the merging holes with the orbital angular momentum is very efficient. We analyze the spin evolution in three specific scenarios: (1) spin evolves only through mergers, (2) spin evolves through mergers and prolonged accretion episodes, and (3) spin evolves through mergers and short-lived (chaotic) accretion episodes. We study how different diagnostics can distinguish between these evolutionary scenarios, assessing the discriminating power of gravitational-wave measurements and X-ray spectroscopy. Gravitational radiation can produce three different types of spin measurements, yielding, respectively, the spins of the two black holes in a binary inspiral prior to merger, the spin of the merger remnant (as encoded in the ring-down waves), and the spin of ``single'' black holes during the extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) of compact objects. The latter spin population is also accessible to iron-line measurements. We compute and compare the spin distributions relevant for these different observations. If iron-line measurements and gravitational-wave observations of EMRIs only yield dimensionless spins j=J/M2&gt;0.9, then prolonged accretion should be responsible for spin-up, and chaotic accretion scenarios would be very unlikely. If only a fraction of the whole population of low-redshift black holes spins rapidly, spin-alignment during binary mergers (rather than prolonged accretion) could be responsible for spin-ups.},

@article{Amaro-Seoane2011c,
abstract = {Several galaxies have exhibited X-ray flares that are consistent with the tidal disruption of a star by a central supermassive black hole. In theoretical treatments of this process it is usually assumed that the star was initially on a nearly parabolic orbit relative to the black hole. Such an assumption leads in the simplest approximation to a $t^{-5/3}$ decay of the bolometric luminosity and this is indeed consistent with the relatively poorly sampled light curves of such flares. We point out that there is another regime in which the decay would be different: if a binary is tidally separated and the star that remains close to the hole is eventually tidally disrupted from a moderate eccentricity orbit, the decay is slower, typically $\sim t^{-1.2}$. As a result, careful sampling of the light curves of such flares could distinguish between these processes and yield insight into the dynamics of binaries as well as single stars in galactic centres. We explore this process using three-body simulations and analytic treatments and discuss the consequences for present-day X-ray detections and future gravitational wave observations.},

Gravitational waves will allow us to probe a complimentary, yet previously unexplored regime: the non-linear and dynamical strong-field regime. Such a regime is, for example, applicable to compact binaries coalescing, where characteristic velocities can reach fifty percent the speed of light and compactnesses can reach a half. This review begins with the theoretical basis and the predicted gravitational wave observables of modified gravity theories.

abstract = {A tetrad-based procedure is presented for solving Einstein's field equations for spherically-symmetric systems; this approach was first discussed by Lasenby et al. in the language of geometric algebra. The method is used to derive metrics describing a point mass in a spatially-flat, open and closed expanding universe respectively. In the spatially-flat case, a simple coordinate transformation relates the metric to the corresponding one derived by McVittie. Nonetheless, our use of non-comoving (`physical') coordinates greatly facilitates physical interpretation. For the open and closed universes, our metrics describe different spacetimes to the corresponding McVittie metrics and we believe the latter to be incorrect. In the closed case, our metric possesses an image mass at the antipodal point of the universe. We calculate the geodesic equations for the spatially-flat metric and interpret them. For radial motion in the Newtonian limit, the force acting on a test particle consists of the usual $1/r^2$ inwards component due to the central mass and a cosmological component proportional to $r$ that is directed outwards (inwards) when the expansion of the universe is accelerating (decelerating). For the standard $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology, the cosmological force reverses direction at about $z\approx 0.67$. We also derive an invariant fully general-relativistic expression, valid for arbitrary spherically-symmetric systems, for the force required to hold a test particle at rest relative to the central point mass.},

abstract = {Binaries consisting of a pulsar and a black hole (BH) are a holy grail of astrophysics, both for their significance for stellar evolution and for their potential application as probes of strong gravity. In spite of extensive surveys of our Galaxy and its system of globular clusters, no pulsar-black hole (PSR-BH) binary has been found to date. Clues as to where such systems might exist are therefore highly desirable. We show that if the central parsec around Sgr A* harbors a cluster of $\sim$25,000 stellar BHs (as predicted by mass segregation arguments) and if it is also rich in recycled pulsar binaries (by analogy with globular clusters), then 3-body exchange interactions should produce PSR-BHs in the Galactic center. Simple estimates of the formation rate and survival time of these binaries suggest that a few PSR-BHs should be present in the central parsec today. The proposed formation mechanism makes unique predictions for the PSR-BH properties: 1) the binary would reside within $\sim$1 pc of Sgr A*; 2) the pulsar would be recycled, with a period of $\sim$1 to a few tens of milliseconds, and a low magnetic field B<$\sim$10^10 G; 3) the binary would have high eccentricity, e'$\sim$0.8 but with a broad distribution; and 4) the binary would be relatively wide, with semi-major axis a_b'$\sim$0.1 - >$\sim$3 AU. The potential discovery of a PSR-BH binary therefore provides a strong motivation for deep, high-frequency radio searches for recycled pulsars toward the Galactic center.},

We take from the literature several estimates of the redshift dependent galaxy mass function and of the fraction of close galaxy pairs to derive a wide range of galaxy merger rates. We then exploit empirical black hole-host relations to populate merging galaxies with SMBHs. The result of our procedure is a collection of a large number of phenomenological SMBH binary merger rates consistent with current observational constraints on the galaxy assembly at z<1.5. For each merger rate we compute the associated GW signal, eventually producing a large set of estimates of the nHz GW background that we use to infer confidence intervals of its expected amplitude. When considering the most recent SMBH-host relations, accounting for ultra-massive black holes in brightest cluster galaxies, we find that the nominal $1\sigma$ interval of the expected GW signal is only a factor of 3-to-10 below current PTA limits, implying a non negligible chance of detection in the next few years.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of all XMM-Newton and Suzaku X-ray spectra of the nearby luminous Seyfert galaxy Fairall 9. Confirming previous analyses, we find robust evidence for a broad iron line associated with X-ray reflection from the innermost accretion disk. By fitting a spectral model that includes a relativistically ionized reflection component, we examine the constraints on the inclination of the inner accretion disk and the black hole spin, and the complications introduced by the presence of a photoionized emission line system. Employing multi-epoch fitting, we attempt to obtain robust and concordant measures of the accretion disk parameters. We also clearly see a soft X-ray excess in Fairall 9. During certain epochs, the soft excess can be described with same disk reflection component that produces the iron line. However, there are epochs where an additional soft component is required. This can be attributed to either an additional highly-ionized, strongly blurred disk reflection component, or a new X-ray continuum component.},

abstract = {There is a high level of interest in black hole-neutron star binaries, not only because their mergers may be detected by gravitational wave observatories in the coming years, but also because of the possibility that they could explain a class of short duration gamma-ray bursts. We study black hole-neutron star mergers that occur with high eccentricity as may arise from dynamical capture in dense stellar regions such as nuclear or globular clusters. We perform general relativistic simulations of binaries with a range of impact parameters, three different initial black hole spins (zero, aligned and anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum), and neutron stars with three different equations of state. We find a rich diversity across these parameters in the resulting gravitational wave signals and matter dynamics, which should also be reflected in the consequent electromagnetic emission. Before tidal disruption, the gravitational wave emission is significantly larger than perturbative predictions suggest for periapsis distances close to effective innermost stable separations, exhibiting features reflecting the zoom-whirl dynamics of the orbit there. Guided by the simulations, we develop a simple model for the change in orbital parameters of the binary during close encounters. Depending upon the initial parameters of the system, we find that mass transfer during non-merging close encounters can range from essentially zero to a sizable fraction of the initial neutron star mass. The same holds for the amount of material outside the black hole post-merger, and in some cases roughly half of this material is estimated to be unbound. We also see that non-merging close encounters generically excite large oscillations in the neutron star that are qualitatively consistent with f-modes.},

abstract = {We present two methods for integrating forced geodesic equations in the Kerr spacetime, which can accommodate arbitrary forces. As a test case, we compute inspirals under a simple drag force, mimicking the presence of gas. We verify that both methods give the same results for this simple force. We find that drag generally causes eccentricity to increase throughout the inspiral. This is a relativistic effect qualitatively opposite to what is seen in gravitational-radiation-driven inspirals, and similar to what is observed in hydrodynamic simulations of gaseous binaries. We provide an analytic explanation by deriving the leading order relativistic correction to the Newtonian dynamics. If observed, an increasing eccentricity would provide clear evidence that the inspiral was occurring in a non-vacuum environment. Our two methods are especially useful for evolving orbits in the adiabatic regime. Both use the method of osculating orbits, in which each point on the orbit is characterized by the parameters of the geodesic with the same instantaneous position and velocity. Both methods describe the orbit in terms of the geodesic energy, axial angular momentum, Carter constant, azimuthal phase, and two angular variables that increase monotonically and are relativistic generalizations of the eccentric anomaly. The two methods differ in their treatment of the orbital phases and the representation of the force. In one method the geodesic phase and phase constant are evolved together as a single orbital phase parameter, and the force is expressed in terms of its components on the Kinnersley orthonormal tetrad. In the second method, the phase constants of the geodesic motion are evolved separately and the force is expressed in terms of its Boyer-Lindquist components. This second approach is a generalization of earlier work by Pound and Poisson for planar forces in a Schwarzschild background.},

abstract = {We present results on the evolution of the intrinsic scatter of black hole masses considering different implementations of a model in which black holes only grow via mergers. We demonstrate how merger driven growth affects the correlations between black hole mass and host bulge mass. The simple case of an initially lognormal distributed scatter in black hole and bulge masses combined with random merging within the galaxy population results in a decreasing scatter with merging generation/number as predicted by the central-limit theorem. In general we find that the decrease in scatter $\sigma$ is well approximated by $\sigma$merg(m) $\sim$ $\sigma$ini × (m + 1)- a/2 with a = 0.42 for a range of mean number of mergers m < 50. For a large mean number of mergers (m > 100) we find a convergence to a = 0.61. This is valid for a wide range of different initial distributions, refill-scenarios or merger mass ratios. Growth scenarios based on halo merger trees of a (100Mpc)3 $\Lambda$CDM-simulation show a similar behaviour with a scatter decrease of a = 0.30 with typical number of mergers m < 50 consistent with random merging (best matching model: a = 0.34). Assuming a present-day scatter of 0.3 dex in black hole mass and a mean number of mergers not exceeding m = 50 our results imply a scatter of 0.6 dex at z = 3 and thus a possible scenario in which overmassive (and undermassive) black holes at high redshift are a consequence of a larger intrinsic scatter in black hole mass. A simple toy model connecting the growth of black holes to the growth of $\Lambda$CDM haloes via mergers, neglecting any contribution from accretion, yields a consistent M•-MBulge relation at z = 0 - if we assume the correct initial relation.},

abstract = {Observations over the past 20 years have revealed a strong relationship between the properties of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) lying at the center of a galaxy and the host galaxy itself. The magnitude of the spin of the black hole will play a key role in determining the nature of this relationship. To date, direct estimates of black hole spin have been restricted to the local Universe. Herein, we present the results of an analysis of $\sim$ 0.5 Ms of archival Chandra observations of the gravitationally lensed quasar Q 2237+305 (aka the "Einstein-cross"), lying at a redshift of z = 1.695. The boost in flux provided by the gravitational lens allows constraints to be placed on the spin of a black hole at such high redshift for the first time. Utilizing state of the art relativistic disk reflection models, the black hole is found to have a spin of $a_* = 0.74^{+0.06}_{-0.03}$ at the 90% confidence level. Placing a lower limit on the spin, we find $a_* \geq 0.65$ (4$\sigma$). The high value of the spin for the $\rm \sim 10^9\sim M_{\odot}$ black hole in Q 2237+305 lends further support to the coherent accretion scenario for black hole growth. This is the most distant black hole for which the spin has been directly constrained to date.},

abstract = {Gravitational wave detectors are typically described as responding to gravitational wave metric perturbations, which are gauge-dependent and --- correspondingly --- unphysical quantities. This is particularly true for ground-based interferometric detectors, like LIGO, space-based detectors, like LISA and its derivatives, spacecraft doppler tracking detectors, and pulsar timing arrays detectors. The description of gravitational waves, and a gravitational wave detector's response, to the unphysical metric perturbation has lead to a proliferation of false analogies and descriptions regarding how these detectors function, and true misunderstandings of the physical character of gravitational waves.   Here we provide a fully physical and gauge invariant description of the response of a wide class of gravitational wave detectors in terms of the Riemann curvature, the physical quantity that describes gravitational phenomena in general relativity. In the limit of high frequency gravitational waves, the Riemann curvature separates into two independent gauge invariant quantities: a "background" curvature contribution and a "wave" curvature contribution. In this limit the gravitational wave contribution to the detector response reduces to an integral of the gravitational wave contribution of the curvature along the unperturbed photon path between components of the detector. The description presented here provides an unambiguous physical description of what a gravitational wave detector measures and how it operates, a simple means of computing corrections to a detectors response owing to general detector motion, a straightforward way of connecting the results of numerical relativity simulations to gravitational wave detection, and a basis for a general and fully relativistic pulsar timing formula.},

abstract = {Theories of gravity other than general relativity (GR) can explain the observed cosmic acceleration without a cosmological constant. One such class of theories of gravity is f(R). Metric f(R) theories have been proven to be equivalent to Brans-Dicke (BD) scalar-tensor gravity without a kinetic term. Using this equivalence and a 3+1 decomposition of the theory it has been shown that metric f(R) gravity admits a well-posed initial value problem. However, it has not been proven that the 3+1 evolution equations of metric f(R) gravity preserve the (hamiltonian and momentum) constraints. In this paper we show that this is indeed the case. In addition, we show that the mathematical form of the constraint propagation equations in BD-equilavent f(R) gravity and in f(R) gravity in both the Jordan and Einstein frames, is exactly the same as in the standard ADM 3+1 decomposition of GR. Finally, we point out that current numerical relativity codes can incorporate the 3+1 evolution equations of metric f(R) gravity by modifying the stress-energy tensor and adding an additional scalar field evolution equation. We hope that this work will serve as a starting point for relativists to develop fully dynamical codes for valid f(R) models.},

abstract = {Like all true stars, massive stars are gravitationally confined thermonuclear reactors whose composition evolves as energy is lost to radiation and neutrinos. Unlike lower-mass stars (M&lt;$\sim$8Msolar), however, no point is ever reached at which a massive star can be fully supported by electron degeneracy. Instead, the center evolves to ever higher temperatures, fusing ever heavier elements until a core of iron is produced. The collapse of this iron core to a neutron star releases an enormous amount of energy, a tiny fraction of which is sufficient to explode the star as a supernova. The authors examine our current understanding of the lives and deaths of massive stars, with special attention to the relevant nuclear and stellar physics. Emphasis is placed upon their post-helium-burning evolution. Current views regarding the supernova explosion mechanism are reviewed, and the hydrodynamics of supernova shock propagation and ``fallback'' is discussed. The calculated neutron star masses, supernova light curves, and spectra from these model stars are shown to be consistent with observations. During all phases, particular attention is paid to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Such stars are capable of producing, with few exceptions, the isotopes between mass 16 and 88 as well as a large fraction of still heavier elements made by the r and p processes.},

abstract = {In this paper we extend our previous works on spherically symmetric accretion onto black holes and super-spinars to the case in which the fluid has a finite angular momentum initially. We run 2.5D and 3D general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the accretion of a fat disk. We study how the accretion process changes by changing the values of the parameters of our model. We show that the value of the fluid angular momentum critically determines turn-on and off the production of powerful equatorial outflows around super-spinars. For corotating disks, equatorial outflows are efficiently generated, even for relatively low spin parameters or relatively large super-spinar radii. For counterrotating disks, equatorial outflows are instead significantly suppressed, and they are possible only in limited cases. We also study accretion around a tilted disk.},

@article{Trenti2013,
abstract = {It is widely believed that globular clusters evolve over many two-body relaxation times toward a state of energy equipartition, so that velocity dispersion scales with stellar mass as \sigma m^{-\eta} with \eta = 0.5. We show that this is incorrect, using direct N-body simulations with a variety of realistic IMFs and initial conditions. No simulated system ever reaches a state close to equipartition. Near the center, the luminous main-sequence stars reach a maximum \eta_{max} $\sim$ 0.15 \pm 0.03. At large times, all radial bins convergence on an asymptotic value \eta_{\infty} $\sim$ 0.08 \pm 0.02. The development of this "partial equipartition" is strikingly similar across our simulations, despite the range of initial conditions employed. Compact remnants tend to have higher \eta than main-sequence stars (but still \eta < 0.5), due to their steeper (evolved) mass function. The presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) decreases \eta, consistent with our previous findings of a quenching of mass segregation under these conditions. All these results can be understood as a consequence of the Spitzer instability for two-component systems, extended by Vishniac to a continuous mass spectrum. Mass segregation (the tendency of heavier stars to sink toward the core) has often been studied observationally, but energy equipartition has not. Due to the advent of high-quality proper motion datasets from the Hubble Space Telescope, it is now possible to measure \eta. Detailed data-model comparisons open up a new observational window on globular cluster dynamics, structure, evolution, initial conditions, and possible IMBHs. Comparison of our simulations to Omega Cen observations yields good agreement, confirming that globular clusters are not generally in energy equipartition. Modeling techniques that assume equipartition by construction (e.g., multi-mass Michie-King models) are approximate at best.},

@article{Greenhill2003,
abstract = {We present the first VLBI maps of H2O maser emission ($\lambda$1.3 cm) in the nucleus of the Circinus galaxy, constructed from data obtained with the Australia Telescope Long Baseline Array. The maser emission traces a warped, edge-on accretion disk between radii of 0.11+/-0.02 and $\sim$0.40 pc, as well as a wide-angle outflow that extends up to $\sim$1 pc from the estimated disk center. The disk rotation is close to Keplerian (v$\sim$r-0.5), the maximum detected rotation speed is 260 km s-1, and the inferred central mass is (1.7+/-0.3)×106 Msolar. The outflowing masers are irregularly distributed above and below the disk, with relative outflow velocities up to $\sim$+/-160 km s-1, projected along the line of sight. The flow probably originates closer than 0.1 pc to the central engine, possibly in an inward extension of the accretion disk, although there is only weak evidence of rotation in the outward-moving material. We observe that the warp of the disk appears to collimate the outflow and to fix the extent of the ionization cone observed on larger angular scales. This study provides the first direct evidence (i.e., through imaging) of dusty, high-density, molecular material in a nuclear outflow less than 1 pc from the central engine of a Seyfert galaxy, as well as the first graphic evidence that warped accretion disks can channel outflows and illumination patterns in active galactic nuclei. We speculate that the same arrangement, which in some ways obviates the need for a geometrically thick, dusty torus, may apply to other type 2 active galactic nuclei.},

We estimate the cosmological rate of such events, assuming MBHs are quite common in galaxies.

abstract = {A generic class of theories where gravity is mediated by one tensor field together with an arbitrary
 number of scalar fields is considered. The predictions of these theories are worked out in four
 different observationally relevant regimes: (i) quasi-stationary weak fields (solar system
 conditions); (ii) rapidly varying weak fields (gravitational wave experiments); (iii)
 quasi-stationary strong fields (motion of systems of compact bodies, i.e. neutron stars or black
 holes); and (iv) the mixing of strong and radiative field effects in the gravitational radiation of
 N-compact-body systems. Moreover, the authors derive several significant relations between the
 theoretical quantities entering these predictions. They show how strong-field-gravity effects in the
 motion and gravitational radiation of N-compact-body systems can be parametrized by a set of theory
 parameters that generalize the usual post-Newtonian parameters ( gamma , beta ,. . .) introduced in
 the context of quasi-stationary weak gravitational fields. These new parameters ( beta 2 , beta ',
 beta 3 , beta ",. . .) provide a chart for the yet essentially unexplored domain of
 strong-gravitational-field effects, and thereby suggest new directions for testing relativistic
 gravity. This is illustrated by studying in detail a specific two-parameter tensor-bi-scalar theory
 T( beta ', beta ") which has the same post-Newtonian limit as general relativity but leads to new
 nonEinsteinian predictions for the various observables that can be extracted from binary pulsar
 data.},

However there exist astrophysical foregrounds and among them, gravitational waves from neutron star (NS) binaries are the solid and strong component that must be identified and subtracted. In this paper, we discuss the geometry of detector configurations preferable for identifying the NS/NS binary signals. As a first step, we analytically estimate the minimum signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the binaries for several static detector configurations that are characterized by adjustable geometrical parameters, and determine the optimal values for these parameters. Next we perform numerical simulations to take into account the effect of detector motions, and find reasonable agreements with the analytical results. We show that, with the standard network formed by 4 units of triangle detectors, the proposed BBO sensitivity would be sufficient in receiving gravitational waves from all the NS/NS binaries at $z\le 5$ with SNRs higher than 25. We also discuss the minimum sensitivity of DECIGO required for the foreground identification.},

The redistribution may be determined using an approach pioneered by Gondolo and Silk: begin with a model distribution function for the dark matter, and ``grow'' the black hole adiabatically, holding the adiabatic invariants of the motion constant. Unlike the approach of Gondolo and Silk, which adopted Newtonian theory together with ad hoc correction factors to mimic general relativistic effects, we carry out the calculation fully relativistically, using the exact Schwarzschild geometry of the black hole. We find that the density of dark matter generically vanishes at r=2R_S, not 4R_S as found by Gondolo and Silk, where R_S is the Schwarzschild radius, and that the spike very close to the black hole reaches significantly higher densities. We apply the relativistic adiabatic growth framework to obtain the final dark matter density for both cored and cusped initial distributions. Besides the implications of these results for indirect detection estimates, we show that the gravitational effects of such a dark matter spike are significantly smaller than the relativistic effects of the black hole, including frame dragging and quadrupolar effects, for stars orbiting close to the black hole that might be candidates for testing the black hole no-hair theorems.},

abstract = {Prominent K-shell emission lines of neutral iron (hereafter, FeI-K) and hard-continuum X-rays were found from molecular clouds (MCs) in the Sagittarius B (Sgr B) region with the two separate Suzaku observations in 2005 and 2009. The X-ray flux of FeI-K decreased in correlation to the hard-continuum flux by factor of 0.4-0.5 in 4 years, which is nearly equal to the light-travelling across the MCs. The rapid and correlated time-variability, the equivalent width of FeI-K, and the K-edge absorption depth of FeI are consistently explained by "X-ray echoes" due to the fluorescent and Thomson-scattering of an X-ray flare from an external source. The required flux of the X-ray flare depends on the distance to the MCs and the duration time. The flux, even in the minimum case, is larger than those of the brightest Galactic X-ray sources. Based on these facts, we conclude that the super-massive black hole, Sgr A*, exhibited a big-flare about a few hundred years ago and the luminosity of higher than 4x10^39 erg s^{-1}. The "X-ray echo" from Sgr B, located at a few hundred light-years from Sgr A*, now arrived at the Earth.},

The observations consist of two visits of five orbits each, in 2004 April and July.

The size of the C IV-emitting region is about a factor of 3 smaller than expected if the slope of the broad-line region radius-luminosity relationship is identical to that for the H$\beta$ emission line. NGC 4395 is underluminous even for its small black hole mass; the Eddington ratio of $\sim$1.2×10-3 is lower than that of any other active galactic nucleus for which a black hole mass measurement has been made by emission-line reverberation.},

In the test we constrain the value of the dimensionless parameter q that relates the scaled quadrupole moment and spin of the primary black hole: q2 = -q 2 . At the present we can say that q = 1 \pm 0.3 (one), in agreement with General Relativity and the no-hair theorems. We demonstrate that this result can be improved if more observational data is found in historical plate archives for the 1959 and 1971 outbursts. We also show that the predicted 2015 and 2019 outbursts will be crucial in improving the accuracy of the test. Space-based photometry is required in 2019 July due the proximity of OJ287 to the Sun at the time of the outburst. The best situation would be to carry out the photometry far from the Earth, from quite a different vantage point, in order to avoid the influence of the nearby Sun. We have considered in particular the STEREO space mission which would be ideal if it has a continuation in 2019 or LORRI on board the New Horizons mission to Pluto.},

abstract = {Direct detection of low-frequency gravitational waves ($10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$ Hz) is the main goal of pulsar timing array (PTA) projects. One of the main targets for the PTAs is to measure the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) whose characteristic strain is expected to approximately follow a power-law of the form $h_c(f)=A (f/\hbox{yr}^{-1})^{\alpha}$, where $f$ is the gravitational-wave frequency. In this paper we use the current data from the European PTA to determine an upper limit on the GWB amplitude $A$ as a function of the unknown spectral slope $\alpha$ with a Bayesian algorithm, by modelling the GWB as a random Gaussian process. For the case $\alpha=-2/3$, which is expected if the GWB is produced by supermassive black-hole binaries, we obtain a 95% confidence upper limit on $A$ of $6\times 10^{-15}$, which is 1.8 times lower than the 95% confidence GWB limit obtained by the Parkes PTA in 2006. Our approach to the data analysis incorporates the multi-telescope nature of the European PTA and thus can serve as a useful template for future intercontinental PTA collaborations.},

abstract = {The final inspiral of double neutron star and neutron star-black hole binaries are likely to be detected by advanced networks of ground-based gravitational wave (GW) interferometers. Maximizing the science returns from such a discovery will require the identification and localization of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. Here we critically evaluate and compare several possible counterparts, including short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), "orphan" optical and radio afterglows, and $\sim$day-long optical transients powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei synthesized in the merger ejecta ("kilonovae"). We assess the promise of each counterpart in terms of four "Cardinal Virtues": detectability, high fraction, identifiability, and positional accuracy. Taking into account the search strategy for typical error regions of $\sim$10s degs sq., we conclude that SGRBs are the most useful to confirm the cosmic origin of a few GW events, and to test the association with NS mergers. However, for the more ambitious goal of localizing and obtaining redshifts for a large sample of GW events, kilonovae are instead preferred. Off-axis optical afterglows will be detectable for at most $\sim$10% of all events, while radio afterglows are promising only for the unique combination of energetic relativistic ejecta in a high density medium, and even then will require hundreds of hours of EVLA time per event. Our main recommendations are:(i) an all-sky gamma-ray satellite is essential for temporal coincidence detections, and for GW searches of gamma-ray triggered events; (ii) LSST should adopt a 1-day cadence follow-up strategy, ideally with $\sim$0.5 hr per pointing to cover GW error regions (the standard 4-day cadence and depth will severely limit the probability of a unique identification); and (iii) radio searches should only focus on the relativistic case, which requires observations for a few months.},

This work extends a recent study which relates dynamical friction to the interaction of the object with background fluctuations in an infinite homogeneous medium. The new approach has some limitations, but it still provides a better estimate for the friction in nonhomogeneous media than does Chandrasekhar's formula. The drag no longer depends only on local background characteristics as in the homogeneous case, but is a function of the global structure of the entire mass density field. In contrast to Chandrasekhar's formula, the frictional force now turns out to depend also on the object's direction of motion with respect to gradients in the surrounding mass distribution.},

abstract = {Galaxy centers are residing places for Super Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). Galaxy mergers bring SMBHs close together to form gravitationally bound binary systems which, if able to coalesce in less than a Hubble time, would be one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In spherical galaxy models, SMBH binaries stall at a separation of approximately one parsec, leading to the "final parsec problem" (FPP). On the other hand, it has been shown that merger-induced triaxiality of the remnant in equal-mass mergers is capable of supporting a constant supply of stars on so-called centrophilic orbits that interact with the binary and thus avoid the FPP. In this paper, using a set of direct N-body simulations of mergers of initially spherically symmetric galaxies with different mass ratios, we show that the merger-induced triaxiality is able to drive unequal-mass SMBH binaries to coalescence. The binary hardening rates are high and depend only weakly on the mass ratios of SMBHs for a wide range of mass ratios q. The hardening rates are significantly higher for galaxies having steep cusps in comparison with those having shallow cups at centers. The evolution of the binary SMBH leads to relatively shallower inner slopes at the centers of the merger remnants. The stellar mass displaced by the SMBH binary on its way to coalescence is $\sim$ 1-5 times the combined mass of binary SMBHs. The coalescence times for SMBH binary with mass $\sim$ million solar masses are less than 1 Gyr and for those at the upper end of SMBH masses ($\sim$ billion solar masses) are 1-2 Gyr for less eccentric binaries whereas less than 1 Gyr for highly eccentric binaries. SMBH binaries are thus expected to be promising sources of gravitational waves at low and high redshifts.},

The semianalytical Fisher-matrix formalism provides lower bounds on the spread of the maximum-likelihood estimator across noise realizations; it also provides the leading-order width of the posterior probability density. However, the Fisher matrix is limited to the high-SNR limit, which is often not realized in practice. By contrast, Bayesian-inference Monte Carlos characterize the full posterior as a function of noise for any SNR, but they are usually too computationally costly to repeat for a representative sample of noise realizations. In this article, I describe a semianalytical technique to exactly map the sampling distribution of the maximum-likelihood estimator across noise realizations at any SNR, generating an intermediate amount of information with significantly less computation. This technique can be applied to any estimation problem characterized by additive Gaussian noise.},

It begins by testing possible 'equilibrium' distributions for binaries against the results of computational experiments, but is mainly concerned with the dynamics of encounters between binaries and other members of the system. Using an impulsive approximation, it is shown that pairs with low binding energies tend to be disrupted by encounters. The theory for energetic pairs is complicated by the considerably richer variety of possible phenomena, including distant encounters in which changes in eccentricity much exceed changes in energy, and exchange events in which an incoming star may replace one component of the binary. The result of all types of encounter is that energetic pairs tend to become more energetic, at an average rate which is approximately independent of their binding energy.},

abstract = {Interacting galaxies often have complexes of hundreds of young stellar clusters of individual masses $\sim$ 10^{4-6} Msun in regions that are a few hundred parsecs across. These cluster complexes interact dynamically, and their coalescence is a candidate for the origin of some ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Individual clusters with short relaxation times are candidates for the production of intermediate-mass black holes of a few hundred solar masses, via runaway stellar collisions prior to the first supernovae in a cluster. It is therefore possible that a cluster complex hosts multiple intermediate-mass black holes that may be ejected from their individual clusters due to mergers or binary processes, but bound to the complex as a whole. Here we explore the dynamical interaction between initially free-flying massive black holes and clusters in an evolving cluster complex. We find that, after hitting some clusters, it is plausible that the massive black hole will be captured in an ultracompact dwarf forming near the center of the complex. In the process, the hole typically triggers electromagnetic flares via stellar disruptions, and is also likely to be a prominent source of gravitational radiation for the advanced ground-based detectors LIGO and VIRGO. We also discuss other implications of this scenario, notably that the central black hole could be considerably larger than expected in other formation scenarios for ultracompact dwarfs.},

It is shown that the total force on this body can be separated into two independent parts, one of which is the slowly varying influence of the aggregate stellar system, and the other being the rapidly fluctuating stochastic force due to discrete encounters with individual stars. For the particular example of a stellar system distributed according to a Plummer model, it is shown that the motion of the black hole is then similar to that of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential, and we analyze its dynamics using an approach akin to Langevin's solution of the Brownian motion problem. The equations are solved to obtain the average values, time autocorrelation functions, and probability distributions of the black hole's position and velocity. By comparing these results with N-body simulations, we demonstrate that this model provides a very good statistical description of the actual black hole dynamics. As an application of our model, we use our results to derive a lower limit on the mass of the black hole Sgr A* in the Galactic center.},

abstract = {Computation of the marginal likelihood from a simulated posterior distribution is central to Bayesian model selection but is computationally difficult. I argue that the marginal likelihood can be reliably computed from a posterior sample by careful attention to the numerics of the probability integral. Posing the expression for the marginal likelihood as a Lebesgue integral, we may convert the harmonic mean approximation from a sample statistic to a quadrature rule. As a quadrature, the harmonic mean approximation suffers from enormous truncation error as consequence . In addition, I demonstrate that the integral expression for the harmonic-mean approximation converges slowly at best for high-dimensional problems with uninformative prior distributions. These observations lead to two computationally-modest families of quadrature algorithms that use the full generality sample posterior but without the instability. The first algorithm automatically eliminates the part of the sample that contributes large truncation error. The second algorithm uses the posterior sample to assign probability to a partition of the sample space and performs the marginal likelihood integral directly. This eliminates convergence issues. The first algorithm is analogous to standard quadrature but can only be applied for convergent problems. The second is a hybrid of cubature: it uses the posterior to discover and tessellate the subset of that sample space was explored and uses quantiles to compute a representive field value. Neither algorithm makes strong assumptions about the shape of the posterior distribution and neither is sensitive outliers. [abridged]},

abstract = {An extreme-mass-ratio burst (EMRB) is a gravitational wave signal emitted when a compact object passes through periapsis on a highly eccentric orbit about a much more massive body, in our case a stellar mass object about the 4.31 \times 10^6 M_sol massive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic Centre. We investigate how EMRBs could constrain the parameters of the Galaxy's MBH. EMRBs should be detectable if the periapsis is r_p < 65 r_g for a \mu = 10 M_sol orbiting object, where r_g = GM/c^2 is the gravitational radius. The signal-to-noise ratio \rho scales like log(\rho) = -2.7 log(r_p/r_g) + log(\mu/M_sol) + 4.9. For periapses smaller than $\sim$ 10 r_g, EMRBs can be informative, providing good constraints on both the MBH's mass and spin.},

abstract = {In this paper, the helium core of an 8.8 solar mass star is evolved from the helium-burning stage through the early stage of collapse of an O + Ne + Mg core. The star undergoes helium and carbon burning under nondegenerate conditions and leaves an O + Ne + Mg core. The penetration of the surface convection zone into the helium layer starts much earlier than in a 9.6 solar mass star studied elsewhere. The subsequent evolution is brought about by hydrogen-helium double-shell burning. The mass interior to the helium-burning shell, M(Heb), increases toward the Chandrasekhar limit. After M(Heb) reaches 1.375 solar mass, electron captures on Mg-24, Na-24, Ne-20, and F-20 take place. The electron concentration decreases, the resulting rapid core contraction ignites the oxygen deflagration, and the material undergoes incineration into nuclear statistical equilibrium at the oxygen deflagration front. The collapse of the core is accelerated, and the oxygen deflagration front advances.},

@article{Flanagan2012,
abstract = {We show that transient resonances occur in the two body problem in general relativity, in the highly relativistic, extreme mass-ratio regime for spinning black holes. These resonances occur when the ratio of polar and radial orbital frequencies, which is slowly evolving under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction, passes through a low order rational number. At such points, the adiabatic approximation to the orbital evolution breaks down, and there is a brief but order unity correction to the inspiral rate. Corrections to the gravitational wave signal's phase due to resonance effects scale as the square root of the inverse of mass of the small body, and thus become large in the extreme-mass-ratio limit, dominating over all other post-adiabatic effects. The resonances make orbits more sensitive to changes in initial data (though not quite chaotic), and are genuine non-perturbative effects that are not seen at any order in a standard post-Newtonian expansion. Our results apply to an important potential source of gravitational waves, the gradual inspiral of white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes into much more massive black holes. It is hoped to exploit observations of these sources to map the spacetime geometry of black holes. However, such mapping will require accurate models of binary dynamics, which is a computational challenge whose difficulty is significantly increased by resonance effects. We estimate that the resonance phase shifts will be of order a few tens of cycles for mass ratios $\sim 10^{-6}$, by numerically evolving fully relativistic orbital dynamics supplemented with an approximate, post-Newtonian self-force.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to supermassive black hole binary mergers observed by LISA can be localized to within the field of view of astronomical instruments $\sim$10 deg^2 hours to weeks prior to coalescence. The temporal coincidence of any prompt EM counterpart with a gravitationally-timed merger may offer the best chance of identifying a unique host galaxy. We discuss the challenges posed by searches for prompt EM counterparts and propose novel observational strategies to address them. In particular, we discuss the size and shape evolution of the LISA localization error ellipses on the sky, and quantify the requirements for dedicated EM surveys of the area prior to coalescence. A triggered EM counterpart search campaign will require monitoring a several-square degree area. It could aim for variability at the 24-27 mag level in optical bands, for example, which corresponds to 1-10% of the Eddington luminosity of the prime LISA sources of 10^6-10^7 Msun BHs at z=1-2, on time-scales of minutes to hours, the orbital time-scale of the binary in the last 2-4 weeks. A cross-correlation of the period of any variable EM signal with the quasi-periodic gravitational waveform over 10-1000 cycles may aid the detection. Alternatively, EM searches can detect a transient signal accompanying the coalescence. We highlight the measurement of differences in the arrival times of photons and gravitons from the same cosmological source as a valuable independent test of the massive character of gravity, and of possible violations of Lorentz invariance in the gravity sector.},

abstract = {We explore the cosmological dynamics of an effective f(R) model constructed from a renormalisation group (RG) improvement of the Einstein--Hilbert action, using the non-perturbative beta functions of the exact renormalisation group equation. The resulting f(R) model has some remarkable properties. It naturally exhibits an unstable de Sitter era in the ultraviolet (UV), dynamically connected to a stable de Sitter era in the IR, via a period of radiation and matter domination, thereby describing a non-singular universe. We find that the UV de Sitter point is one of an infinite set, which make the UV RG fixed point inaccessible to classical cosmological evolution. In the vicinity of the fixed point, the model behaves as R^2 gravity, while it correctly recovers General Relativity at solar system scales. In this simplified model, the fluctuations are too large to be the observed ones, and more ingredients in the action are needed.},

abstract = {A star orbiting a supermassive black hole can be tidally disrupted if the black hole's gravitational tidal field exceeds the star's self gravity at pericenter. Some of stellar tidal debris can become gravitationally bound to the black hole and be subsequently accreted, leading to a bright electromagnetic flare. In the Newtonian limit, this flare will have a light curve that scales as t^-5/3 if the tidal debris has a flat distribution in binding energy. We investigate the time dependence of the black-hole mass accretion rate when tidal disruption occurs close enough the black hole that relativistic effects are significant. We find that for orbits with pericenters comparable to the radius of the marginally bound circular orbit, relativistic effects can double the peak accretion rate and halve the time it takes to reach this peak accretion rate. The accretion rate depends on both the magnitude of the black-hole spin and its orientation with respect to the stellar orbit; for orbits with a given pericenter radius in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, a maximal black-hole spin anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum leads to the largest peak accretion rate.},

Due to this particular formalism, Loop Quantum Gravity was generally considered as a quantization scheme that applies only to General Relativity. However, we will show that the nonperturbative quantization procedure of Loop Quantum Gravity can be extended to a rather general class of metric theories of gravity, which have received increased attention recently due to motivations coming form cosmology and astrophysics. In particular, we will first introduce how to reformulate the 4-dimensional metric $f(R)$ theories of gravity, as well as Brans-Dicke theory, into connection-dynamical formalism with real SU(2) connections as configuration variables. Through these formalisms, we then outline the nonpertubative canonical quantization of the $f(R)$ theories and Brans-Dicke theory by extending the loop quantization scheme of General Relativity.},

We perform polarized radiative transfer calculations with our ASTRORAY code in order to explore the manifestations of these QPOs for Sgr A*. We construct a simulation-based model of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow and find model parameters by fitting the mean observed polarized source spectrum. The simulated QPOs have a total sub-mm flux amplitude of under 5% and a linearly polarized flux amplitude of up to 2%. The oscillation period $T\approx100M\approx35$ min corresponds to the rotation period of the BH magnetosphere that produces a trailing spiral in resolved disk images. The total flux signal is statistically significant over noise for all tested frequencies 87 GHz, 230 GHz, and 857 GHz and inclination angles $10^\circ,$ $37^\circ,$ and $80^\circ$. The non-detection in the 230 GHz Sub-Millimeter Array light curve is consistent with a low signal level and low sampling rate.

Each period can be identified with one of the characteristic gravitational cyclic modes associated with accretion disks, i.e. either Lense-Thirring precession, Kepler orbital motion and the vertical and radial epicyclic oscillation modes, in such a way that a consistent value for the black hole mass of MBH = 2.72 +0.12-0.19× 10 6 Msun and the angular momentum a = 0.9939 +0.0026-0.0074 is obtained. The available data on MBH derived from studies of the orbital motion of the S2 (S0-2) star (Sch\"{o}del et al. \cite{S2002}; Ghez et al. \cite{Gh2003}) agree with our findings. Finally we discuss some implications of the fairly high value for the angular momentum.},

abstract = {We present the results of simulated injections testing the first Bayesian search-pipeline capable of investigating the angular-structure of a gravitational-wave (GW) background influencing pulsar signals. A stochastic background of GWs from the incoherent superposition of many inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries at nHz frequencies is likely to be the dominant GW signal detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Even though one might expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population of sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative of local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the angular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in pulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars. In an isotropic background this cross-correlation follows a distinctive relationship, known as the Hellings and Downs curve, that depends only on the angular separation of the pulsars. If the background is anisotropic, the cross-correlation is different, but predictable, and also depends on the absolute position of the pulsars. By simulating datasets containing GWBs with various anisotropic configurations, we have explored the prospects for constraining anisotropy using near future data. We find that at moderate to high signal to noise ratio the assumption of isotropy is no longer an appropriate description of the simulated background. Furthermore, we can recover the nature of the injected anisotropy in a Bayesian parameter-estimation search, and propose a prior on the anisotropy search-space motivated by the physicality of the implied distribution of sources.},

abstract = {Transient orbital resonances have recently been identified as potentially important to the inspiral of small bodies into large black holes. These resonances occur as the inspiral evolves through moments in which two fundamental orbital frequencies, $\Omega_\theta$ and $\Omega_r$, are in a small integer ratio to one another. Previous work has demonstrated that a binary's parameters are "kicked" each time the inspiral passes through a resonance, changing the orbit's characteristics relative to a model that neglects resonant effects. In this paper, we use exact Kerr geodesics coupled to an accurate but approximate model of inspiral to survey orbital parameter space and estimate how commonly one encounters long-lived orbital resonances. We find that the most important resonances last for a few hundred orbital cycles at mass ratio $10^{-6}$, and that resonances are almost certain to occur during the time that a large mass ratio binary would be a target of gravitational-wave observations. Resonances appear to be ubiquitous in large mass ratio inspiral, and to last long enough that they are likely to affect binary evolution in observationally important ways.},

The dynamical model of EPM2004 ephemerides includes the mutual perturbations from major planets and the Moon computed in terms of General Relativity with allowance for effects due to lunar physical libration, perturbations from 301 big asteroids, and dynamic perturbations due to the solar oblateness and the massive asteroid ring with uniform mass distribution in the plane of the ecliptic. The EPM2004 ephemerides resulted from a least-squares adjustment to more than 317000 position observations (1913–2003) of various types, including radiometric measurements of planets and spacecraft, CCD astrometric observations of the outer planets and their satellites, and meridian and photographic observations. The high-precision ephemerides constructed made it possible to determine, from modern radiometric measurements, a wide range of astrometric constants, including the astronomical unit AU = (149597870.6960 ± 0.0001) km, parameters of the rotation of Mars, the masses of the biggest asteroids, the solar quadrupole moment J2 = (1.9 ± 0.3) × 10-7, and the parameters of the PPN formalism \ss and ?.

To this purpose we investigate the linearised Einstein's equations with terms up to linear order in $\Lambda$ in a de Sitter and an anti-de Sitter background spacetime. In this framework the cosmological term does not induce changes in the polarization states of the waves, whereas the amplitude gets modified with terms depending on $\Lambda$. Moreover, if a source emits a periodic waveform, its periodicity as measured by a distant observer gets modified. These effects are, however, extremely tiny and thus well below the detectability by some twenty orders of magnitude within present gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO or future planned ones such as LISA.},

abstract = {Many relevant applications in gravitational wave physics share a significant common problem: the seven-dimensional parameter space of gravitational waveforms from precessing compact binary inspirals and coalescences is large enough to prohibit covering the space of waveforms with sufficient density. We find that by using the reduced basis method together with a parametrization of waveforms based on their phase and precession, we can construct ultra-compact yet high-accuracy representations of this large space. As a demonstration, we show that less than $100$ judiciously chosen precessing inspiral waveforms are needed for $200$ cycles, mass ratios from $1$ to $10$ and spin magnitudes $\le 0.9$. In fact, using only the first $10$ reduced basis waveforms yields a maximum mismatch of $0.016$ over the whole range of considered parameters. We test whether the parameters selected from the inspiral regime result in an accurate reduced basis when including merger and ringdown; we find that this is indeed the case in the context of a non-precessing effective-one-body model. This evidence suggests that as few as $\sim 100$ numerical simulations of binary black hole coalescences may accurately represent the seven-dimensional parameter space of precession waveforms for the considered ranges.},

For standard theoretical parameters the SNR reaches middle to high double figures even with modest assumptions about instrument performance and saddle approach. Obvious concerns, like systematics arising from LPF self-gravity, or the Newtonian background, are examined and shown not to be a problem. We also investigate the impact of a negative observational result upon the free-function determining the theory. We demonstrate that, if Newton's gravitational constant is constrained not be re-normalized by more than a few percent, only very contrived MONDian free-functions would survive a negative result. Finally we scan the structure of all proposed relativistic MONDian theories. We conclude that only the Einstein-Aether formulation would survive a negative result.},

Linear polarization is a second-rank symmetric and traceless tensor, which can be decomposed on a sphere into spin +/-2 spherical harmonics. These are the analogues of the spherical harmonics used in the temperature maps and obey the same completeness and orthogonality relations. We show that there exist two linear combinations of spin +/-2 multipole moments which have opposite parities and can be used to fully characterize the statistical properties of polarization in the CMB. Magnetic-type parity combination does not receive contributions from scalar modes and does not cross correlate with either temperature or electric-type parity combination, so there are four different power spectra that fully characterize statistical properties of CMB. We present their explicit expressions for scalar and tensor modes in the form of line of sight integral solution and numerically evaluate them for a representative set of models. These general solutions differ from the expressions obtained previously in the small scale limit both for scalar and tensor modes. A method to generate and analyze all-sky maps of temperature and polarization is given and the optimal estimators for various power spectra and their corresponding variances are discussed.},

Under the plausible assumption that tidal interactions are efficient at aligning the spins of few-solar mass black-hole progenitors with the orbital angular momentum, we find that black-hole spins should be expected to preferentially lie in a plane when they become detectable by gravitational-wave interferometers. This “resonant plane” is identified by the conditions $\Delta$$\Phi$=0° or $\Delta$$\Phi$=±180°, where $\Delta$$\Phi$ is the angle between the components of the black-hole spins in the plane orthogonal to the orbital angular momentum. If the angles $\Delta$$\Phi$ can be accurately measured for a large sample of gravitational-wave detections, their distribution will constrain models of compact binary formation. In particular, it will tell us whether tidal interactions are efficient and whether a mechanism such as mass transfer, stellar winds, or supernovae can induce a mass-ratio reversal (so that the heavier black hole is produced by the initially lighter stellar progenitor). Therefore, our model offers a concrete observational link between gravitational-wave measurements and astrophysics. We also hope that it will stimulate further studies of precessional dynamics, gravitational-wave template placement, and parameter estimation for binaries locked in the resonant plane.},

abstract = {Inferring the astrophysical parameters of coalescing compact binaries is a key science goal of the upcoming advanced LIGO-Virgo gravitational-wave detector network and, more generally, gravitational-wave astronomy. However, current parameter estimation approaches for such scenarios can lead to computationally intractable problems in practice. Therefore there is a pressing need for new, fast and accurate Bayesian inference techniques. In this letter we demonstrate that a reduced order modeling approach enables rapid parameter estimation studies. By implementing a reduced order quadrature scheme within the LIGO Algorithm Library, we show that Bayesian inference on the 9-dimensional parameter space of non-spinning binary neutron star inspirals can be sped up by a factor of 30 for the early advanced detectors' configurations. This speed-up will increase to about $150$ as the detectors improve their low-frequency limit to 10Hz, reducing to hours analyses which would otherwise take months to complete. Although these results focus on gravitational detectors, the techniques are broadly applicable to any experiment where fast Bayesian analysis is desirable.},

Horava's model, and its variants, show dramatically improved ultra-violet behaviour at the cost of exhibiting violation of Lorentz invariance at ultra-high momenta. Following up on our earlier note, [arXiv:0904.4464 [hep-th]], we discuss in more detail our variant of Horava's model. In contrast to Horava's original model, we abandon "detailed balance" and restore parity invariance. We retain, however, Horava's "projectability condition" and explore its implications. Under these conditions, we explicitly exhibit the most general model, and extract the full classical equations of motion in ADM form. We analyze both spin-2 and spin-0 graviton propagators around flat Minkowski space. We furthermore analyze the classical evolution of FLRW cosmologies in this model, demonstrating that the higher-derivative spatial curvature terms can be used to mimic radiation fluid and stiff matter. We conclude with some observations concerning future prospects.},

We map these parameterized metrics to each other via a diffeomorphism and to known analytical black hole solutions in alternative theories of gravity. The parameterized metrics presented here serve as frameworks for the systematic calculation of extreme-mass ratio inspiral waveforms in parameterized non-GR theories and the investigation of the accuracy to which space-borne gravitational wave detectors can constrain such deviations.},

abstract = {We present an improved version of the approximate scheme for generating inspirals of test-bodies into a Kerr black hole recently developed by Glampedakis, Hughes and Kennefick. Their original "hybrid" scheme was based on combining exact relativistic expressions for the evolution of the orbital elements (the semi-latus rectum p and eccentricity e) with approximate, weak-field, formula for the energy and angular momentum fluxes, amended by the assumption of constant inclination angle, iota, during the inspiral. Despite the fact that the resulting inspirals were overall well-behaved, certain pathologies remained for orbits in the strong field regime and for orbits which are nearly circular and/or nearly polar. In this paper we eliminate these problems by incorporating an array of improvements in the approximate fluxes. Firstly, we add certain corrections which ensure the correct behaviour of the fluxes in the limit of vanishing eccentricity and/or 90 degrees inclination. Secondly, we use higher order post-Newtonian formulae, adapted for generic orbits. Thirdly, we drop the assumption of constant inclination. Instead, we first evolve the Carter constant by means of an approximate post-Newtonian expression and subsequently extract the evolution of iota. Finally, we improve the evolution of circular orbits by using fits to the angular momentum and inclination evolution determined by Teukolsky based calculations. As an application of the improved scheme we provide a sample of generic Kerr inspirals and for the specific case of nearly circular orbits we locate the critical radius where orbits begin to decircularise under radiation reaction. These easy-to-generate inspirals should become a useful tool for exploring LISA data analysis issues and may ultimately play a role in source detection.},

abstract = {The future LISA detector will constitute the prime instrument for high-precision gravitational wave observations.LISA is expected to provide information for the properties of spacetime in the vicinity of massive black holes which reside in galactic nuclei.Such black holes can capture stellar-mass compact objects, which afterwards slowly inspiral,radiating gravitational waves.The body's orbital motion and the associated waveform carry information about the spacetime metric of the massive black hole,and it is possible to extract this information and experimentally identify (or not!) a Kerr black hole.In this paper we lay the foundations for a practical `spacetime-mapping' framework. Our work is based on the assumption that the massive body is not necessarily a Kerr black hole, and that the vacuum exterior spacetime is stationary axisymmetric,described by a metric which deviates slightly from the Kerr metric. We first provide a simple recipe for building such a `quasi-Kerr' metric by adding to the Kerr metric the deviation in the value of the quadrupole moment. We then study geodesic motion in this metric,focusing on equatorial orbits. We proceed by computing `kludge' waveforms which we compare with their Kerr counterparts. We find that a modest deviation from the Kerr metric is sufficient for producing a significant mismatch between the waveforms, provided we fix the orbital parameters. This result suggests that an attempt to use Kerr waveform templates for studying EMRIs around a non-Kerr object might result in serious loss of signal-to-noise ratio and total number of detected events. The waveform comparisons also unveil a `confusion' problem, that is the possibility of matching a true non-Kerr waveform with a Kerr template of different orbital parameters.},

The combination of system parameters makes this binary pulsar the most relativistic binary pulsar known and allows unique tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity. Hence, we summarize the importance of the system for such tests, and pay attention, for instance, to the observed measurement of relativistic spin precession which confirms the 'effacement' property of a spinning body. We also present a method to use measurements of the absolute position angle of the linearly polarized radio emission of the pulsars to measure the rate of the relativistic spin precession. We demonstrate how spin orbit coupling will eventually allow us to determine the moment-of-inertia of pulsar A, and provide a general outlook into the prospects of future observations of the double pulsar.},

We have further developed the field-theoretical formulation of the general relativity which treats gravity as a nonlinear tensor field in flat space-time. The Minkowski metric is a reflection of experimental facts, not a possible choice of the artificial “prior geometry.” In this approach, we have arrived at the gravitational energy-momentum tensor which is (1) derivable from the Lagrangian in a regular prescribed way, (2) a tensor under arbitrary coordinate transformations, (3) symmetric in its components, (4) conserved due to the equations of motion derived from the same Lagrangian, (5) free of the second (highest) derivatives of the field variables, and (6) is unique up to trivial modifications not containing the field variables. There is nothing else, in addition to these six conditions, that one could demand from an energy-momentum object, acceptable both on physical and mathematical grounds.

abstract = {Astrophysical black hole candidates are thought to be the Kerr black holes predicted by General Relativity, but there is not yet clear evidence that the geometry of the space-time around these objects is really described by the Kerr metric. In order to confirm the Kerr black hole hypothesis, we have to observe strong gravity features and check that they are in agreement with the ones predicted by General Relativity. In this paper, I study the broad K$\alpha$ iron line, which is often seen in the X-ray spectrum of both stellar-mass and super-massive black hole candidates and whose shape is supposed to be strongly affected by the space-time geometry. As found in previous studies in the literature, there is a strong correlation between the spin parameter and the deformation parameter; that is, the line emitted around a Kerr black hole with a certain spin can be very similar to the one coming from the space-time around a non-Kerr object with a quite different spin. Despite that, the analysis of the broad K$\alpha$ iron line is potentially more powerful than the continuum-fitting method, as it can put an interesting bound on possible deviations from the Kerr geometry independently of the value of the spin parameter and without additional measurements.},

For example, it does not permit the inclusion of only one of the second order Lagrangians in \emph{isolation}. But, it does allow the inclusion of the cosmological term.

We derive a dimensional dependent version of Duff's trace anomaly relation, which in \emph{four}-dimension is the same as the usual Duff relation.

abstract = {The future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will be able to measure parameters of coalescing massive black hole binaries, often to extremely high accuracy. Previous work has demonstrated that the black hole spins can have a strong impact on the accuracy of parameter measurement. Relativistic spin-induced precession modulates the waveform in a manner which can break degeneracies between parameters, in principle significantly improving how well they are measured. Recent studies have indicated, however, that spin precession may be weak for an important subset of astrophysical binary black holes: those in which the spins are aligned due to interactions with gas. In this paper, we examine how well a binary's parameters can be measured when its spins are partially aligned and compare results using waveforms that include higher post-Newtonian harmonics to those that are truncated at leading quadrupole order. We find that the weakened precession can substantially degrade parameter estimation, particularly for the "extrinsic" parameters sky position and distance. Absent higher harmonics, LISA typically localizes the sky position of a nearly aligned binary about an order of magnitude less accurately than one for which the spin orientations are random. Our knowledge of a source's sky position will thus be worst for the gas-rich systems which are most likely to produce electromagnetic counterparts. Fortunately, higher harmonics of the waveform can make up for this degradation. By including harmonics beyond the quadrupole in our waveform model, we find that the accuracy with which most of the binary's parameters are measured can be substantially improved. In some cases, the improvement is such that they are measured almost as well as when the binary spins are randomly aligned.},

To this end, we compile the Hamiltonian equations of motion describing the conservative dynamics of the most general black hole binaries, as computed by Will and collaborators, and incorporate an effective treatment of dissipation through gravitational radiation. We evolve these equations for systems with orbital eccentricity and precessing spins. We find that, while spin-spin coupling corrections can destroy constant radius orbits in principle, the effect is so small that orbits will reliably tend to quasi-spherical orbits as angular momentum and energy are lost to gravitational radiation. Still, binaries that are initially highly eccentric may retain eccentricity as they pass into the detectable bandwidth of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We also show that a useful set of natural frequencies for an orbit demonstrating both spin precession and periastron precession is comprised of (1) the frequency of angular motion in the orbital plane, (2) the frequency of the plane precession, and (3) the frequency of radial oscillations. These three natural harmonics shape the observed waveform.},

abstract = {The Kerr family of solutions of the Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell equations is the most general class of solutions known at present which could represent the field of a rotating neutral or electrically charged body in asymptotically flat space. When the charge and specific angular momentum are small compared with the mass, the part of the manifold which is stationary in the strict sense is incomplete at a Killing horizon. Analytically extended manifolds are constructed in order to remove this incompleteness. Some general methods for the analysis of causal behavior are described and applied. It is shown that in all except the spherically symmetric cases there is nontrivial causality violation, i.e., there are closed timelike lines which are not removable by taking a covering space; moreover, when the charge or angular momentum is so large that there are no Killing horizons, this causality violation is of the most flagrant possible kind in that it is possible to connect any event to any other by a future-directed timelike line. Although the symmetries provide only three constants of the motion, a fourth one turns out to be obtainable from the unexpected separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, with the result that the equations, not only of geodesics but also of charged-particle orbits, can be integrated completely in terms of explicit quadratures. This makes it possible to prove that in the extended manifolds all geodesics which do not reach the central ring singularities are complete, and also that those timelike or null geodesics which do reach the singularities are entirely confined to the equator, with the further restriction, in the charged case, that they be null with a certain uniquely determined direction. The physical significance of these results is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {The S-Stars in the Galactic-center region are found to be on near-perfect Keplerian orbits around presumably a supermassive black hole, with periods of 15-50 yr. Since these stars reach a few percent of light speed at pericenter, various relativistic effects are expected, and have been discussed in the literature. We argue that an elegant test of the Einstein equivalence principle should be possible with existing instruments, through spectroscopic monitoring of an S-star concentrated during the months around pericenter, supplemented with an already-adequate astrometric determination of the inclination. In essence, the spectrum of an S-star can be considered a heterogeneous ensemble of clocks in a freely-falling frame, which near pericenter is moving at relativistic speeds.},

We find one class that admits solutions that solve the vacuum Einstein equations and another that does not.

abstract = {Compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the most promising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Gravitational radiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameter estimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detection candidate events. Detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inference on several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location and distance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources. However, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of models describing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data, uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors. Here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals added either in hardware or software to the data collected by the two LIGO instruments and the Virgo detector during their most recent joint science run, including a "blind injection" where the signal was not initially revealed to the collaboration. We exemplify the ability to extract information about the source physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameter space over the individual mass range 1 Msun - 25 Msun and the full range of spin parameters. The cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of the status of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanced detectors.},

abstract = {We describe a pseudo-Newtonian potential which, to within 1% error at all angular momenta, reproduces the precession due to general relativity of particles whose specific orbital energy is small compared to c^2 in the Schwarzschild metric. For bound orbits the constraint of low energy is equivalent to requiring the apoapsis of a particle to be large compared to the Schwarzschild radius. Such low energy orbits are ubiquitous close to supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei, but the potential is relevant in any context containing particles on low energy orbits. Like the more complex post-Newtonian expressions, the potential correctly reproduces the precession in the far-field, but also correctly reproduces the position and magnitude of the logarithmic divergence in precession for low angular momentum orbits. An additional advantage lies in its simplicity, both in computation and implementation. We also provide two simpler, but less accurate potentials, for cases where orbits always remain at large angular momenta, or when the extra accuracy is not needed. In all of the presented cases the accuracy in precession in low energy orbits exceeds that of the well known potential of Paczynski & Wiita (1980), which has $\sim$30% error in the precession at all angular momenta.},

We then investigate the covariant Galileon model and show that the parameter space consistent with the background expansion history is excluded by the RSD data at more than 10 sigma because of the too large growth rate predicted by the theory. Finally, we consider the extended Galileon scenario, and we find that, in contrast to the covariant Galileon, there is a model parameter space for a tracker solution that is consistent with the RSD data within a 2 sigma level.},

Extended, central X-ray sources observed in NGC 6388 and in G1 in M31 could be interpreted as being powered by the accretion of matter onto such objects. In this work we explore a scenario in which the black hole accretes from the cluster interstellar medium, which is generated by the mass loss of the red giants in the cluster. We estimate the accretion rate onto the black hole and compare it to the values obtained via the traditional Bondi-Hoyle model. Our results show that the accretion rate is no longer solely defined by the black hole mass and the ambient parameters but also by the host cluster itself. Furthermore, we find that the more massive globular clusters with large stellar velocity dispersion are the best candidates in which accretion onto IMBHs could be detected.},

We demonstrate that observations with 10% uncertainties of at least three neutron stars can lead to measurements of the pressure at these fiducial densities with an accuracy of 0.11 dex or $\sim$ 30%. Observations of three neutron stars with 5% uncertainties are sufficient to distinguish at a better than 3-sigma confidence level between currently proposed equations of state. In the electromagnetic spectrum, such accurate measurements will become possible for weakly-magnetic neutron stars during thermonuclear flashes and in quiescence with future missions such as the International X-ray Observatory (IXO).},

The observations were obtained with the laser guide star adaptive optics systems on the W. M. Keck I and II telescopes (2006-2012) and include spectroscopy (R $\sim$ 3600) centered on the hydrogen Br$\gamma$ line as well as K' (2.1 $\mu$m) and L' (3.8 $\mu$m) imaging. Analysis of these observations shows the Br$\gamma$ line emission has a positional offset from the L' continuum. This offset is likely due to background source confusion at L'. We therefore present the first orbital solution derived from Br$\gamma$ line astrometry, which, when coupled with radial velocity measurements, results in a later time of closest approach (2014.21 ± 0.14), closer periastron (130 AU, 1600 R s), and higher eccentricity (0.9814 ± 0.0060) compared to a solution using L' astrometry. It is shown that G2 has no K' counterpart down to K' $\sim$ 20 mag. G2's L' continuum and the Br$\gamma$ line emission appears unresolved in almost all epochs, which implies that the bulk of the emission resides in a compact region. The observations altogether suggest that while G2 has a gaseous component that is tidally interacting with the central black hole, there is likely a central star providing the self-gravity necessary to sustain the compact nature of this object.},

abstract = {Waveform templates are a powerful tool for extracting and characterizing gravitational wave signals, acting as highly restrictive priors on the signal morphologies that allow us to extract weak events buried deep in the instrumental noise. The templates map the waveform shapes to physical parameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions for these parameters. However, there are attendant dangers in using highly restrictive signal priors. If strong field gravity is not accurately described by General Relativity (GR), then using GR templates may result in fundamental bias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detect signals. Here we study such dangers, concentrating on three distinct possibilities. First, we show that there exist modified theories compatible with all existing tests that would fail to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo network using searches based on GR templates, but which would be detected using a one parameter post-Einsteinian extension. Second, we study modified theories that produce departures from GR that turn on suddenly at a critical frequency, producing waveforms that do not naively fit into the simplest parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) scheme. We show that even the simplest ppE templates are still capable of picking up these strange signals and diagnosing a departure from GR. Third, we study whether using inspiral-only ppE waveforms for signals that include merger and ringdown can lead to problems in misidentifying a GR departure. We present an easy technique that allows us to self-consistently identify the inspiral portion of the signal, and thus remove these potential biases, allowing GR tests to be performed on higher mass signals that merge within the detector band. We close by studying a parameterized waveform model that may allow us to test GR using the full inspiral-merger-ringdown signal.},

In this paper, we study numerically sun-like configurations for one such proposed model, namely Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model having the chameleon property.   Chameleon gravity theories are stated to reproduce general relativistic behavior within high curvature regime. Therefore stationary spherically symmetric configurations of $f(R)$ gravity with polytropic equation of state and regular metrics at the origin have been studied numerically and compared with general relativistic Eddington polytropes.   To determine the metric deviation from relativistic Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution, post-Newtonian parametrization is used around the $f(R)$ polytropes. Since, Birkhoff's theorem does not need to hold within a modified gravity theory, the solution outside may be different. We find that although Schwarzchildian space-times can be produced with this model, they demand fine-tuning.},

We use TempoNest to show that at noise levels representative of current datasets in the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) the linear timing model can underestimate the uncertainties of the timing solution by up to an order of magnitude. We also show how to perform Bayesian model selection between different sets of timing model and stochastic parameters, for example, by demonstrating that in the pulsar B1937+21 both the dispersion measure variations and spin noise in the data are optimally modelled by simple power laws. Finally we show that not including the stochastic parameters simultaneously with the timing model can lead to unpredictable variation in the estimated uncertainties, compromising the robustness of the scientific results extracted from such analysis.},

abstract = {One of the primary objectives for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is to detect a stochastic background generated by the incoherent superposition of gravitational waves (GWs), in particular from the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries. Current stochastic background searches assume that pulsars in a PTA are separated from each other and the Earth by many GW wavelengths. As more millisecond pulsars are discovered and added to PTAs, some may be separated by only a few radiation wavelengths or less, resulting in correlated GW phase changes between close pulsars in the array. Here we investigate how PTA overlap reduction functions (ORFs), up to quadrupole order, are affected by these additional correlated phase changes, and how they are in turn affected by relaxing the assumption that all pulsars are equidistant from the solar system barycenter. We find that in the low frequency GW background limit of $f\sim10^{-9}$$\sim$Hz, and for pulsars at varying distances from the Earth, that these additional correlations only affect the ORFs by a few percent for pulsar pairs at large angular separations, as expected. However when nearby (order 100 pc) pulsars are separated by less than a few degrees, the correlated phase changes can introduce variations of a few tens of percent in the magnitude of the isotropic ORF, and much larger fractional differences in the anisotropic ORFs-- up to 188 in the $m=0$, $l=2$ ORF for equidistant pulsars separated by 3 degrees. In fact, the magnitude of most of the anisotropic ORFs is largest at small, but non-zero, pulsar separations. Finally, we write down a small angle approximation for the correlated phase changes which can easily be implemented in search pipelines, and for completeness, examine the behavior of the ORFs for pulsars which lie at a radiation wavelength from the Earth.},

We find regions of phase space that exhibit resonance behavior, characterized by small librations of the spin vectors around a fixed orientation. Due to the loss of energy and orbital angular momentum through radiation reaction, systems can eventually be captured into these resonance orientations. By investigating the long-term evolution of compact binaries with a variety of initial conditions, we find that the distribution in parameter space can be strongly affected by resonance captures. This has the effect of significantly reducing the size of search space for gravitational wave sources, in turn improving the chances of detecting such sources through methods of template matching. Furthermore, by calculating the expected spin distribution at the end of the inspiral phase, we can predict what are the most likely initial conditions for the plunge phase, a result of great interest for numerical relativity calculations.},

abstract = {Recent observations of quasars powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) out to z $\sim$ 7 constrain both the initial seed masses and the growth of the most massive black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Here we consider the role of radiative feedback from early generations of stars and from BH accretion in popular models for the formation and growth of seed BHs. We show that by properly accounting for (1) the limited role of mergers in growing seed BHs as inferred from recent cosmological simulations, (2) the sub-Eddington accretion rates of BHs expected at the earliest times, and (3) the large radiative efficiencies of the most massive BHs inferred from observations of active galactic nuclei at high redshift, we are led to the conclusion that the initial BH seeds may have been as massive as > 10^5 M_Sun. This presents a strong challenge to the Population III seed model, in which seed masses are expected to be $\sim$ 100 M_Sun, but is consistent with the prediction of the direct collapse scenario of SMBH seed formation, in which a supermassive primordial star forms in a region of the universe with a high molecule-dissociating background radiation field, and collapses directly into a 10^4 -- 10^6 M_Sun seed BH. These results corroborate recent cosmological simulations and observational campaigns which suggest that these massive BHs were the seeds of a large fraction of the SMBHs residing in the centers of galaxies today.},

However, despite decades of research, we still lack a coherent picture of the physical drivers of BH growth, the connection between the growth of BHs and their host galaxies, the role of large-scale environment on the fueling of BHs, and the impact of BH-driven outflows on the growth of galaxies. In this paper we review our progress in addressing these key issues, motivated by the science presented at the "What Drives the Growth of Black Holes?" workshop held at Durham on 26th-29th July 2010, and discuss how these questions may be tackled with current and future facilities.},

abstract = {We present a new approximate method for constructing gravitational radiation driven inspirals of test-bodies orbiting Kerr black holes. Such orbits can be fully described by a semi-latus rectum $p$, an eccentricity $e$, and an inclination angle $\iota$; or, by an energy $E$, an angular momentum component $L_z$, and a third constant $Q$. Our scheme uses expressions that are exact (within an adiabatic approximation) for the rates of change ($\dot{p}$, $\dot{e}$, $\dot{\iota}$) as linear combinations of the fluxes ($\dot{E}$, $\dot{L_z}$, $\dot{Q}$), but uses quadrupole-order formulae for these fluxes. This scheme thus encodes the exact orbital dynamics, augmenting it with approximate radiation reaction. Comparing inspiral trajectories, we find that this approximation agrees well with numerical results for the special cases of eccentric equatorial and circular inclined orbits, far more accurate than corresponding weak-field formulae for ($\dot{p}$, $\dot{e}$, $\dot{\iota}$). We use this technique to study the inspiral of a test-body in inclined, eccentric Kerr orbits. Our results should be useful tools for constructing approximate waveforms that can be used to study data analysis problems for the future LISA gravitational-wave observatory, in lieu of waveforms from more rigorous techniques that are currently under development.},

abstract = {We present new and stronger evidence for a previously reported relationship between galactic spiral arm pitch angle P (a measure of the tightness of spiral structure) and the mass M_BH of a disk galaxy's nuclear supermassive black hole (SMBH). We use an improved method to accurately measure the spiral arm pitch angle in disk galaxies to generate quantitative data on this morphological feature for 34 galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. We find a relation of log(M/M_sun) = (8.21 +/- 0.16) - (0.062 +/- 0.009)P. This method is compared with other means of estimating black hole mass to determine its effectiveness and usefulness relative to other existing relations. We argue that such a relationship is predicted by leading theories of spiral structure in disk galaxies, including the density wave theory. We propose this relationship as a tool for estimating SMBH masses in disk galaxies. This tool is potentially superior when compared to other methods for this class of galaxy, and has the advantage of being unambiguously measurable from imaging data alone.},

abstract = {Detection of a gravitational-wave stochastic background via ground or space-based gravitational-wave detectors requires the cross-correlation of the response of two or more independent detectors. The cross-correlation involves a frequency-dependent factor -- the so-called overlap reduction function or Hellings-Downs curve -- that depends on the relative geometry of each detector pair: i.e., the detector separations and the relative orientation of their antenna patterns (beams). An incorrect formulation of this geometrical factor has appeared in the literature, leading to incorrect conclusions regarding the sensitivity of proposed detectors to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. To rectify these errors and as a reference for future work we provide here a complete, first-principles derivation of the overlap reduction function and assess the nature of the errors associated with the use of the incorrect expression that has appeared in the literature. We describe the behavior of the overlap reduction function in different limiting regimes, and show how the difference between the correct and incorrect expressions can be understood physically.},

Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR grism observations of a clumpy galaxy at z=1.35, with evidence for 10^6 - 10^7 Msun rapidly growing black holes in separate sub-components of the host galaxy. These black holes could have been brought into close proximity as a consequence of a rare multiple galaxy merger or they could have formed in situ. Such holes would eventually merge into a central black hole as the stellar clumps/components presumably coalesce to form a galaxy bulge. If we are witnessing the in-situ formation of multiple black holes, their properties can inform seed formation models and raise the possibility that massive black holes can continue to emerge in star-forming galaxies as late as z=1.35 (4.8 Gyr after the Big Bang).},

abstract = {Stars on eccentric orbits around a massive black hole (MBH) emit bursts of gravitational waves (GWs) at periapse. Such events may be directly resolvable in the Galactic centre. However, if the star does not spiral in, the emitted GWs are not resolvable for extra-galactic MBHs, but constitute a source of background noise. We estimate the power spectrum of this extreme mass ratio burst background (EMBB) and compare it to the anticipated instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). To this end, we model the regions close to a MBH, accounting for mass-segregation, and for processes that limit the presence of stars close to the MBH, such as GW inspiral and hydrodynamical collisions between stars. We find that the EMBB is dominated by GW bursts from stellar mass black holes, and the magnitude of the noise spectrum (f S_GW)^{1/2} is at least a factor $\sim$10 smaller than the instrumental noise. As an additional result of our analysis, we show that LISA is unlikely to detect relativistic bursts in the Galactic centre.},

It is found that stellar evolution and tidal disruption are the predominant mass-loss mechanisms for low-density nuclei, whereas physical collisions dominate in high-density nuclei. For initial central densities greater than 10 million solar masses/cu pc the core of the stellar system contacts due to the removal of kinetic energy by collisions, whereas for densities less than this the core of the stellar system expands due to heating that results from the settling of a small population of stars into orbits tightly bound to the black hole. These mechanisms produce differing power-law slopes in the resulting stellar density cusp surrounding the black hole, -7/4 and -1/2 for low- and high-density nuclei, respectively.},

abstract = {The lunar ranging measurements now being made at the McDonald Observatory have an accuracy of 1 nsec in round-trip travel time. This corresponds to 15 cm in the one-way distance. The use of lasers with pulse-lengths of less than 1 nsec is expected to give an accuracy of 2 to 3 cm in the next few years. A new station is under construction in Hawaii, and additional stations in other countries are either in operation or under development. It is hoped that these stations will form the basis for a worldwide network to determine polar motion and earth rotation on a regular basis, and will assist in providing information about movement of the tectonic plates making up the earth's surface. Several mobile lunar ranging stations with telescopes having diameters of 1.0 m or less could, in the future, greatly extend the information obtainable about motions within and between the tectonic plates. The data obtained so far by the McDonald Observatory have been used to generate a new lunar ephemeris based on direct numerical integration of the equations of motion for the moon and planets. With this ephemeris, the range to the three Apollo retro-reflectors can be fit to an accuracy of 5 m by adjusting the differences in moments of inertia of the moon about its principal axes, the selenocentric coordinates of the reflectors, and the McDonald longitude. The accuracy of fitting the results is limited currently by errors of the order of an arc second in the angular orientation of the moon, as derived from the best available theory of how the moon rotates in response to the torques acting on it. Both a new calculation of the moon's orientation as a function of time based on direct numerical integration of the torque equations and a new analytic theory of the moon's orientation are expected to be available soon, and to improve considerably the accuracy of fitting the data. The accuracy already achieved routinely in lunar laser ranging represents a hundredfold improvement over any previously available knowledge of the distance to points on the lunar surface. Already, extremely complex structure has been observed in the lunar rotation and significant improvement has been achieved in our knowledge of lunar orbit. The selenocentric coordinates of the retroreflectors give improved reference points for use in lunar mapping, and new information on the lunar mass distribution has been obtained. Beyond the applications discussed in this article, however, the history of science shows many cases of previously unknown, phenomena discovered as a consequence of major improvements in the accuracy of measurements. It will be interesting to see whether this once again proves the case as we acquire an extended series of lunar distance observations with decimetric and then centimetric accuracy.},

Whereas one might expect nonlinearities of the gravitational field to introduce non-Gaussianity into the statistics of the lensing convergence field, we show that such corrections are actually always small within a broad class of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. We show this by first computing the weak lensing convergence within our parameterized framework to second order in the gravitational potential, and then computing the relevant post-Newtonian parameters for scalar-tensor gravity theories. In doing so we show that this potential systematic factor is generically negligible, thus clearing the way for weak lensing to provide a direct tracer of mass on cosmological scales despite uncertainties in possible departures from general relativity.},

abstract = {[abridged] Energy relaxation around a massive black hole (MBH) is key to establishing the dynamical state of galactic nuclei, and the nature of close stellar interactions with the MBH. The standard description of relaxation as diffusion provides a perturbative 2nd-order solution in the weak two-body interaction limit. We run N-body simulations and find that this solution fails to describe the non-Gaussian relaxation on short timescale, which is strongly influenced by extreme events even in the weak limit, and is thus difficult to characterize and measure. We derive a non-perturbative solution for relaxation as an anomalous diffusion process, and develop a robust estimation technique to measure it in simulations. These enable us to analyze and model our numerical results, and validate in detail, for the first time, this model of energy relaxation around an MBH on all timescales. We derive the relation between the energy diffusion time, t_E, and the time for a small perturbation to return to steady state, t_r, in a relaxed, single mass cusp around a MBH. We constrain the contribution of strong encounters, measure that of the weakest encounters, determine the value of the Coulomb logarithm, and provide a robust analytical estimate for t_E in a finite nuclear stellar cusp. We find that t_r $\sim$ 10t_E $\sim$(5/32)Q^2P_h/N_h log Q, where Q=M_bh/M_* is the MBH to star mass ratio, the orbital period P_h and number of stars N_h are evaluated at the energy scale corresponding to the MBH's sphere of influence, E_h=sigma_inf^2, where sigma_inf is the velocity dispersion far from the MBH. We conclude, using the observed cosmic M_bh/sigma correlation, that cusps around lower-mass MBHs (M_bh<10^7 Mo), which evolved passively over a Hubble time, should be relaxed. We consider the effects of anomalous energy diffusion on orbital perturbations of stars observed near the Galactic MBH.},

abstract = {For a general class of analytic f(R)-gravity theories, we discuss the weak field limit in view of gravitational lensing. Though an additional Yukawa term in the gravitational potential modifies dynamics with respect to the standard Newtonian limit of General Relativity, the motion of massless particles results unaffected thanks to suitable cancellations in the post-Newtonian limit. Thus, all the lensing observables are equal to the ones known from General Relativity. Since f(R)-gravity is claimed, among other things, to be a possible solution to overcome for the need of dark matter in virialized systems, we discuss the impact of our results on the dynamical and gravitational lensing analyses. In this framework, dynamics could, in principle, be able to reproduce the astrophysical observations without recurring to dark matter, but in the case of gravitational lensing we find that dark matter is an unavoidable ingredient. Another important implication is that gravitational lensing, in the post-Newtonian limit, is not able to constrain these extended theories, since their predictions do not differ from General Relativity.},

It is difficult to carry out the perturbation analysis around the black hole because the linearized Einstein equation is fourth order in $f(R)$ gravity. In order to resolve this difficulty, we transform $f(R)$ gravity into the scalar-tensor theory by introducing two auxiliary scalars. In this case, the linearized curvature scalar becomes a scalaron, showing that all linearized equations are second order, which are the same equations for the massive Brans-Dicke theory. It turns out that the $f(R)$ black hole is stable against the external perturbations if the scalaron does not have a tachyonic mass.},

We now investigate the role these tensors play in a broader theoretical context, demonstrating for the first time that (a) they do indeed constitute Noether currents associated with the symmetry of the linearized gravitational field under translation and rotation, and (b) they are themselves a source of gravity, analogous to the energy-momentum and spin of matter. To prove (a) we construct a Lagrangian for linearized gravity (a covariantized Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian for a massless spin-2 field) and show that our tensors can be obtained from this Lagrangian using a standard variational technique for calculating Noether currents. This approach generates formulae that uniquely generalize our gravitational energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor beyond harmonic gauge: we show that no other generalization can be obtained from a covariantized Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian without introducing second derivatives in the energy-momentum tensor. We then construct the Belinfante energy-momentum tensor associated with our framework (combining spin and energy-momentum into a single object) and as our first demonstration of (b) we establish that this Belinfante tensor appears as the second-order contribution to a perturbative expansion of the Einstein field equations. By considering a perturbative expansion of the Einstein-Cartan field equations, we then demonstrate that (b) can be realized without forming the Belinfante tensor: our energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor appear as the quadratic terms in separate field equations, generating gravity as distinct entities.

Black holes in this mass range are not well constrained by current electromagnetic observations, so LISA could significantly enhance our understanding of the astrophysics of such systems. In this paper, we describe a framework for combining LISA observations to make statements about massive black hole populations. We summarise the constraints that LISA observations of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals might be able to place on the mass function of black holes in the LISA range. We also describe how LISA observations can be used to choose between different models for the hierarchical growth of structure in the early Universe. We consider four models that differ in their prescription for the initial mass distribution of black hole seeds, and in the efficiency of accretion onto the black holes. We show that with as little as 3 months of LISA data we can clearly distinguish between these models, even under relatively pessimistic assumptions about the performance of the detector and our knowledge of the gravitational waveforms.},

abstract = {The search for gravitational waves is one of today's major scientific endeavors. A gravitational wave can interact with matter by exciting vibrations of elastic bodies. Earth itself is a large elastic body whose so-called normal-mode oscillations ring up when a gravitational wave passes. Therefore, precise measurement of vibration amplitudes can be used to search for the elusive gravitational-wave signals. Earth's free oscillations that can be observed after high-magnitude earthquakes have been studied extensively with gravimeters and low-frequency seismometers over many decades leading to invaluable insight into Earth's structure. Making use of our detailed understanding of Earth's normal modes, numerical models are employed for the first time to accurately calculate Earth's gravitational-wave response, and thereby turn a network of sensors that so far has served to improve our understanding of Earth, into an astrophysical observatory exploring our Universe. In this article, we constrain the energy density of gravitational waves to values in the range 0.035 - 0.15 normalized by the critical energy density of the Universe at frequencies between 0.3mHz and 5mHz, using 10 years of data from the gravimeter network of the Global Geodynamics Project that continuously monitors Earth's oscillations. This work is the first step towards a systematic investigation of the sensitivity of gravimeter networks to gravitational waves. Further advance in gravimeter technology could improve sensitivity of these networks and possibly lead to gravitational-wave detection.},

abstract = {The increasing role of general relativity in the dynamics of stellar systems with central massive black holes and in the evolution of hierarchical triple systems inspires a close examination of how post-Newtonian effects are incorporated into N-body dynamics. The majority of approaches incorporate relativity by adding to the Newtonian N-body equations the standard two-body post-Newtonian terms for a given star around the black hole or for the close binary in a triple system. We argue that, for calculating the evolution of such systems over timescales comparable to the relativistic pericenter advance timescale, it is essential to include ``cross terms'' in the equations of motion. These are post-Newtonian terms that represent a coupling between the potential of the central black hole and the potential due to other stars in the system. For hierarchical triple systems, these are couplings between the potential of the inner binary and that of the distant third body. Over pericenter precession timescales, the effects of such terms can actually be ``boosted'' to amplitudes of Newtonian order. We write down the post-Newtonian N-body equations of motion including a central black hole in a truncated form that includes all the relevant cross terms, in a format ready to use for numerical implementation. We do the same for hierarchical triple systems, and illustrate explicitly the effects of cross terms on the orbit-averaged equations of evolution for the orbit elements of the inner binary for the special case where the third body is on a circular orbit. We also describe the inspiration for this investigation: the motion of a test body about a central body with a Newtonian quadrupole moment, including the relativistic pericenter advance, whose correct solution for the conserved total Newtonian energy requires including PN cross terms between the mass monopole and quadrupole potentials.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves emitted during compact binary coalescences are a promising source for gravitational-wave detector networks. The accuracy with which the location of the source on the sky can be inferred from gravitational wave data is a limiting factor for several potential scientific goals of gravitational-wave astronomy, including multi-messenger observations. Various methods have been used to estimate the ability of a proposed network to localize sources. Here we compare two techniques for predicting the uncertainty of sky localization -- timing triangulation and the Fisher information matrix approximations -- with Bayesian inference on the full, coherent data set. We find that timing triangulation alone tends to over-estimate the uncertainty in sky localization by a median factor of $4$ for a set of signals from non-spinning compact object binaries ranging up to a total mass of $20 M_\odot$, and the over-estimation increases with the mass of the system. We find that average predictions can be brought to better agreement by the inclusion of phase consistency information in timing-triangulation techniques. However, even after corrections, these techniques can yield significantly different results to the full analysis on specific mock signals. Thus, while the approximate techniques may be useful in providing rapid, large scale estimates of network localization capability, the fully coherent Bayesian analysis gives more robust results for individual signals, particularly in the presence of detector noise.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves radiated by the coalescence of compact-object binaries containing a neutron star and a black hole are one of the most interesting sources for the ground-based gravitational-wave observatories Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Advanced LIGO will be sensitive to the inspiral of a $1.4\, M_\odot$ neutron star into a $10\,M_\odot$ black hole to a maximum distance of $\sim 900$ Mpc. Achieving this sensitivity and extracting the physics imprinted in observed signals requires accurate modeling of the binary to construct template waveforms. In a NSBH binary, the black hole may have significant angular momentum (spin), which affects the phase evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. We investigate the ability of post-Newtonian (PN) templates to model the gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of NSBH binaries. We restrict the black hole's spin to be aligned with the orbital angular momentum and compare several approximants. We examine restricted amplitude waveforms that are accurate to 3.5PN order in the orbital dynamics and complete to 2.5PN order in the spin dynamics. We also consider PN waveforms with the recently derived 3.5PN spin-orbit and 3PN spin-orbit tail corrections. We compare these approximants to the effective-one-body model. For all these models, large disagreements start at low to moderate black hole spins, particularly for binaries where the spin is anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We show that this divergence begins in the early inspiral at $v \sim 0.2$ for $\chi_{BH} \sim 0.4$. PN spin corrections beyond those currently known will be required for optimal detection searches and to measure the parameters of neutron star--black hole binaries. While this complicates searches, the strong dependence of the gravitational-wave signal on the spin dynamics will make it possible to extract significant astrophysical information.},

@article{Thorne1980,
abstract = {This paper brings together, into a single unified notation, the multipole formalisms for gravitational radiation which various people have constructed. It also extends the results of previous workers. More specifically:Part One of this paper reviews the various scalar, vector, and tensor spherical harmonics used in the general relativity literature—including the Regge-Wheeler harmonics, the symmetric, trace-free ("STF") tensors of Sachs and Pirani, the Newman-Penrose spin-weighted harmonics, and the Mathews-Zerilli Clebsch-Gordan-coupled harmonics—which include "pure-orbital" harmonics and "pure-spin" harmonics. The relationships between the various harmonics are presented. Part One then turns attention to gravitational radiation. The concept of "local wave zone" is introduced to facilitate a clean separation of "wave generation" from "wave propagation." The generic radiation field in the local wave zone is decomposed into multipole components. The energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum in the waves are expressed as infinite sums of multipole contributions. Attention is then restricted to sources that admit a nonsingular, spacetime-covering de Donder coordinate system. (This excludes black holes.) In such a coordinate system the multipole moments of the radiation field are expressed as volume integrals over the source. For slow-motion systems, these source integrals are re-expressed as infinite power series in L/$\lambda$≡(size of source )/(reduced wavelength of waves ). The slow-motion source integrals are then specialized to systems with weak internal gravity to yield (i) the standard Newtonian formulas for the multipole moments, (ii) the post-Newtonian formulas of Epstein and Wagoner, and (iii) post-post-Newtonian formulas.Part Two of this paper derives a multipole-moment wave-generation formalism for slow-motion systems with arbitrarily strong internal gravity, including systems that cannot be covered by de Donder coordinates. In this formalism one calculates, by any means, the source's instantaneous, near-zone, external gravitational field as a solution of the time-independent Einstein field equations. One then reads off of this near-zone field the source's instantaneous multipole moments; and one plugs those time-evolving moments into the standard radiation formulae given in Part One of this paper.As building blocks for this formalism, Part Two also does the following things: (1) In the linearized theory of gravity, for the vacuum exterior of an isolated system, it derives the general solution of the field equations (a result due to Sachs, Bergmann, and Pirani). (2) In full nonlinear general relativity, for the vacuum near-zone exterior of an isolated system, it derives the structure of the general solution of the Einstein field equations. That structure is expressed as a sum of products of multipole contributions. It also matches this near-zone field onto an outgoing-wave radiation field. (3) In full nonlinear general relativity, for the vacuum exterior of a stationary isolated system, (a) it presents a definition of multipole moments which meshes naturally with gravitational-wave theory; (b) it introduces the concept of "asymptotically Cartesian and mass centered" (ACMC) coordinate systems; and (c) it shows how to deduce the multipole moments of a source from the form of its metric in an ACMC coordinate system. As an example, the lowest few (l≤3) multipole moments of the Kerr metric are computed.},

We study how accretion from a warped disk influences the evolution of black hole spins and conclude that within the cosmological framework, where the most massive BHs have grown in mass via merger-driven accretion, one indeed expects most supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies to have on average higher spin than black holes in spiral galaxies, where random, small accretion episodes (e.g., tidally disrupted stars, accretion of molecular clouds) might have played a more important role.},

abstract = {Current simulations of the rate at which stellar-mass compact objects merge with supermassive black holes (called extreme mass ratio in-spirals, or EMRIs) focus on two-body capture by emission of gravitational radiation. The gravitational wave signal of such events will likely involve a significant eccentricity in the sensitivity range of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ( LISA ). We show that tidal separation of stellar-mass compact object binaries by supermassive black holes will instead produce events whose eccentricity is nearly zero in the LISA band. Compared to two-body capture events, tidal separations have a high cross section and result in orbits that have a large pericenter and small apocenter. Therefore, the rate of interactions per binary is high, and the resulting systems are very unlikely to be perturbed by other stars into nearly radial plunges. Depending on the fraction of compact objects that are in binaries within a few parsecs of the center, the rate of low-eccentricity LISA events could be comparable to or larger than the rate of high-eccentricity events.},

abstract = {Direct detection of low-frequency gravitational waves ($10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$ Hz) is the main goal of pulsar timing array (PTA) projects. One of the main targets for the PTAs is to measure the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) whose characteristic strain is expected to approximately follow a power-law of the form $h_c(f)=A (f/\hbox{yr}^{-1})^{\alpha}$, where $f$ is the gravitational-wave frequency. In this paper we use the current data from the European PTA to determine an upper limit on the GWB amplitude $A$ as a function of the unknown spectral slope $\alpha$ with a Bayesian algorithm, by modelling the GWB as a random Gaussian process. For the case $\alpha=-2/3$, which is expected if the GWB is produced by supermassive black-hole binaries, we obtain a 95% confidence upper limit on $A$ of $6\times 10^{-15}$, which is 1.8 times lower than the 95% confidence GWB limit obtained by the Parkes PTA in 2006. Our approach to the data analysis incorporates the multi-telescope nature of the European PTA and thus can serve as a useful template for future intercontinental PTA collaborations.},

abstract = {We present in the following some capabilities of the Gaia mission for performing local test of General Relativity (GR) based on the astrometry of asteroids. This ESA cornerstone mission, to be launched in Spring 2012, will observe—in addition to the stars and QSOs—a large number of small solar system bodies with unprecedented photometric and, mostly, astrometric precisions. Indeed, it is expected that about 250,000 asteroids will be observed with a nominal precision ranging from a few milli-arcsecond (mas), to sub-mas precision, depending on the target's brightness. While the majority of this sample is constituted of known main-belt asteroids orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, a substantial fraction will be made of near-Earth objects, and possibly some newly discovered inner-Earth or co-orbital objects. Here we show the results obtained from a simulation of Gaia observations for local tests of GR in the gravitational field of the Sun. The simulation takes into account the time sequences and geometry of the observations that are particular to Gaia observations of solar system objects, as well as the instrument sensitivity and photon noise. We show the results from a variance analysis for the nominal precision of the joint determination of the solar quadrupole J2 and the PPN parameter $\beta$. Additionally we include the link of the dynamical reference frame to the conventional kinematically non-rotating reference frame (as obtained in the visible wavelength by Gaia observations of QSOs). The study is completed by the determination of a possible variation of the gravitational constant /G, and deviation from Newtonian 1/r2 gravitational law. Comparisons to the results obtained from other techniques are also given.},

@article{Yunes2009a,
abstract = {We consider the concept of fundamental bias in gravitational wave astrophysics as the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity during the entire wave-generation and propagation regime. Such an assumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and observations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where tests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the detection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a mischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source event rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement of waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These parameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates constructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of gravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical principles, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. As an example, we construct parameterized post-Einsteinian templates for the binary coalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circular inspiral. The parametrized post-Einsteinian framework should allow matched filtered data to select a specific set of post-Einsteinian parameters without a priori assuming the validity of the former, thus either verifying general relativity or pointing to possible dynamical strong-field deviations.},

abstract = {Recently a hard X-ray transient event, Sw J1644+57, was discovered by the Swift satellite, which marks the onset of a relativistic jet from a supermassive black hole, likely triggered by a tidal disruption event (TDE). Another candidate in the same category, Sw J2058+05, was also reported. The low event rate suggests that only a small fraction of TDEs launch relativistic jets. A common speculation is that these rare events are related to rapidly spinning black holes. We attribute jet launching to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, and use the available data to constrain the black hole spin parameter for the two events. It is found that the two black holes indeed carry a moderate to high spin, suggesting that black hole spin is likely the crucial factor behind the Sw J1644+57 - like events.},

The relativistic effects that will allow us to measure these higher moments of the gravitational field, however, are very small and may be masked by drag forces that stars and pulsars experience orbiting within the hot, tenuous plasma that surrounds the black hole. The properties of this plasma at large distances from the central object have been measured using observations of the extended X-ray emission that surrounds the point source. At distances comparable to the black-hole event horizon, the properties of the accretion flow have been constrained using observations of its long-wavelength emission and polarization, as well as of the size of the emitting region at 1.3 mm. I use models of the plasma density and temperature at various distances from the black hole to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic drag forces on future measurements of the higher moments of its gravitational field. I find that hydrodynamic drag does not preclude measurements of the black hole spin and quadrupole moment using high-resolution observations of stars and pulsars that orbit within a few thousand gravitational radii from its horizon.},

abstract = {Detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background, particularly radiation from individually unresolvable super-massive black hole binary systems, is one of the primary targets for Pulsar Timing Arrays. Increasingly more stringent upper limits are being set on these signals under the assumption that the background radiation is isotropic. However, some level of anisotropy may be present and the characterisation of the power at different angular scales carries important information. We show that the standard analysis for isotropic backgrounds can be generalised in a conceptually straightforward way to the case of generic anisotropic background radiation by decomposing the angular distribution of the gravitational wave power on the sky into multipole moments. We introduce the concept of generalised overlap reduction functions which characterise the effect of the anisotropy multipoles on the correlation of the timing residuals from the pulsars timed by a Pulsar Timing Array. In a search for a signal characterised by a generic anisotropy, the generalised overlap reduction functions play the role of the so-called Hellings and Downs curve used for isotropic radiation. We compute the generalised overlap reduction functions for a generic level of anisotropy and Pulsar Timing Array configuration. We also provide an order of magnitude estimate of the level of anisotropy that can be expected in the background generated by super-massive black hole binary systems.},

abstract = {The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) is a highly energetic event with consequences dependent on the degree to which the star plunges inside the SMBH's tidal sphere. We introduce a new analytic model for tidal disruption events (TDEs) to analyze the dependence of these events on beta, the ratio of the tidal radius to the orbital pericenter. We find, contrary to most previous work, that the spread in debris energy for a TDE is largely constant for all beta. This result has important consequences for optical transient searches targeting TDEs, which we discuss. We quantify leading-order general relativistic corrections to this spread in energy and find that they are small. We also examine the role of stellar spin, and find that a combination of spin-orbit misalignment, rapid rotation, and high beta may increase the spread in debris energy. Finally, we quantify for the first time the gravitational wave emission due to the strong compression of a star in a high-beta TDE. Although this signal is unlikely to be detectable for disruptions of main sequence stars, the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole can produce a strong signal visible to Advanced LIGO at tens of megaparsecs.},

abstract = {Of the many sources which gravitational wave observatories might see, merging neutron star binaries are the most predictable. Their waveforms at the observable frequencies are easy to calculate. And three systems which will merge in less than a Hubble time have already been observed as binary pulsars: two in the disk of the Galaxy, and one in a globular cluster. From the lifetimes and positions of these, a lower limit to the merger rate in the Galaxy and globular cluster system are inferred with confidence. Taking the merger rate in other galaxies to scale with the star formation rate, the merger rate expected in the local universe is computed. An ultraconservative lower limit to the rate gives three per year within 1 Gpc. The best estimate, still conservative in that it considers only systems like those already observed, gives three per year within 200 Mpc. An upper limit of three mergers per year within 23/h Mpc is set by the rate of Type Ib supernovae. The rates of black hole binary mergers and black hole-neutron star binary mergers are model-dependent, but could be comparable to the given rate of neutron-star binary mergers.},

abstract = {The WMAP mission has produced sky maps from seven years of observations at L2. We present the angular power spectra derived from the seven-year maps and discuss the cosmological conclusions that can be inferred from WMAP data alone. With the seven-year data, the temperature (TT) spectrum measurement has a signal-to-noise ratio per multipole that exceeds unity for l < 919; and in band powers of width $\Delta$ l = 10, the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds unity up to l = 1060. The third acoustic peak in the TT spectrum is now well measured by WMAP . In the context of a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, this improvement allows us to place tighter constraints on the matter density from WMAP data alone, $\Omega$ m h 2 = 0.1334 +0.0056 –0.0055 , and on the epoch of matter-radiation equality, z eq = 3196 +134 –133 . The temperature-polarization (TE) spectrum is detected in the seven-year data with a significance of 20$\sigma$, compared to 13$\sigma$ with the five-year data. We now detect the second dip in the TE spectrum near l $\sim$ 450 with high confidence. The TB and EB spectra remain consistent with zero, thus demonstrating low systematic errors and foreground residuals in the data. The low- l EE spectrum, a measure of the optical depth due to reionization, is detected at 5.5$\sigma$ significance when averaged over l = 2-7: l ( l + 1) C EE l /(2$\pi$) = 0.074 +0.034 –0.025 $\mu$K 2 (68% CL). We now detect the high- l , 24 ≤ l ≤ 800, EE spectrum at over 8$\sigma$. The BB spectrum, an important probe of gravitational waves from inflation, remains consistent with zero; when averaged over l = 2-7, l ( l + 1) C BB l /(2$\pi$) < 0.055 $\mu$K 2 (95% CL). The upper limit on tensor modes from polarization data alone is a factor of two lower with the seven-year data than it was using the five-year data. The data remain consistent with the simple $\Lambda$CDM model: the best-fit TT spectrum has an effective $\chi$ 2 of 1227 for 1170 degrees of freedom, with a probability to exceed of 9.6%. The allowable volume in the six-dimensional space of $\Lambda$CDM parameters has been reduced by a factor of 1.5 relative to the five-year volume, while the $\Lambda$CDM model that allows for tensor modes and a running scalar spectral index has a factor of three lower volume when fit to the seven-year data. We test the parameter recovery process for bias and find that the scalar spectral index, n s , is biased high , but only by 0.09$\sigma$, while the remaining parameters are biased by <0.15$\sigma$. The improvement in the third peak measurement leads to tighter lower limits from WMAP on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (e.g., neutrinos) in the early universe: N eff >2.7(95%CL). Also, using WMAP data alone, the primordial helium mass fraction is found to be Y He = 0.28 +0.14 –0.15 , and with data from higher-resolution cosmic microwave background experiments included, we now establish the existence of pre-stellar helium at >3$\sigma$. These new WMAP measurements provide important tests of big bang cosmology.},

Used with care, this approach gives helpful back‐of‐the‐envelope derivations of important equations and estimates, and it can help to teach gravitational wave phenomena to undergraduates and others not expert in general relativity. We use it to derive the following: the quadrupole approximation for the amplitude h of gravitational waves; a simple upper bound on h in terms of the Newtonian gravitational field of the source; the energy flux in the waves, the luminosity of the source (called the ‘‘quadrupole formula’’), and the radiation reaction in the source; order‐of‐magnitude estimates for radiation from supernovae and binary star systems; and the rate of change of the orbital period of the binary pulsar system. Where our simple results differ from those of general relativity we quote the relativistic ones as well. We finish with a derivation of the principles of detecting gravitational waves, and we discuss the principal types of detectors under construction and the major limitations on their sensitivity.},

abstract = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are now widely used for cosmological parameter estimation. Chains are generated to sample the posterior probability distribution obtained following the Bayesian approach. An important issue is how to optimize the efficiency of such sampling and how to diagnose whether a finite-length chain has adequately sampled the underlying posterior probability distribution. We show how the power spectrum of a single such finite chain may be used as a convergence diagnostic by means of a fitting function, and discuss strategies for optimizing the distribution for the proposed steps. The methods developed are applied to current CMB and LSS data interpreted using both a pure adiabatic cosmological model and a mixed adiabatic/isocurvature cosmological model including possible correlations between modes. For the latter application, because of the increased dimensionality and the presence of degeneracies, the need for tuning MCMC methods for maximum efficiency becomes particularly acute.},

abstract = {The capture of a compact object in a galactic nucleus by a massive black hole (MBH), an extreme-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI), is the best way to map space and time around it. Recent work on stellar dynamics has demonstrated that there seems to be a complot in phase space acting on low-eccentricity captures, since their rates decrease significantly by the presence of a blockade in the rate at which orbital angular momenta change takes place. This so-called "Schwarzschild barrier" is a result of the impact of relativistic precession on to the stellar potential torques, and thus it affects the enhancement on lower-eccentricity EMRIs that one would expect from resonant relaxation. We confirm and quantify the existence of this barrier using a statistical sample of 2,500 direct-summation N-body simulations using both a post-Newtonian and also for the first time in a direct-summation code a geodesic approximation for the relativistic orbits. The existence of the barrier prevents low-eccentricity EMRIs from approaching the central MBH, but high-eccentricity EMRIs, which have been wrongly classified as "direct plunges" until recently, ignore the presence of the barrier, because they are driven by two-body relaxation. Hence, since the rates are significantly affected in the case of low-eccentricity EMRIs, we predict that a LISA-like observatory such as eLISA will predominantly detect high-eccentricity EMRIs.},

Sgr A* is remarkably faint in all wavebands other than the radio region, however, which challenges current theories of matter accretion and radiation surrounding black holes. The black hole's rotation rate is not known, and therefore neither is the structure of space-time around it. Here we report high-resolution infrared observations of Sgr A* that reveal 'quiescent' emission and several flares. The infrared emission originates from within a few milliarcseconds of the black hole, and traces very energetic electrons or moderately hot gas within the innermost accretion region. Two flares exhibit a 17-minute quasi-periodic variability. If the periodicity arises from relativistic modulation of orbiting gas, the emission must come from just outside the event horizon, and the black hole must be rotating at about half of the maximum possible rate.},

abstract = {We study the interaction of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary and a standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disk. We examine steady-state configurations of the disk and migrating SMBH system, self-consistently accounting for tidal and viscous torques and heating, radiative diffusion limited cooling, gas and radiation pressure, and the decay of the binary's orbit. We obtain a "phase diagram" of the system as a function of binary parameters, showing regimes in which both the disk structure and migration have a different character. Although massive binaries can create a central gap in the disk at large radii, the tidal barrier of the secondary causes a significant pile-up of gas outside of its orbit, which can lead to the closing of the gap. We find that this spillover occurs at an orbital separation as large as $\sim$200 M_7^{-1/2} gravitational radii, where M = 10^7 M_7 Msun is the total binary mass. If the secondary is less massive than $\sim$10^6 Msun, then the gap is closed before gravitational waves (GWs) start dominating the orbital decay. In this regime, the disk is still strongly perturbed, but the piled-up gas continuously overflows as in a porous dam, and crosses inside the secondary's orbit. The corresponding migration rate, which we label Type 1.5, is slower than the usual limiting cases known as Type I and II migration. Compared to an unperturbed disk, the steady-state disk in the overflowing regime is up to several hundred times brighter in the optical bands. Surveys such as PanSTARRS or LSST may discover the periodic variability of this population of binaries. Our results imply that the circumbinary disks around SMBHs can extend to small radii during the last stages of their merger, when they are detectable by LISA, and may produce coincident electromagnetic (EM) emission similar to active galactic nuclei (AGN).},

abstract = {We show that the black hole-bulge mass scaling relations observed from the local to the high-z Universe can be largely or even entirely explained by a non-causal origin, i.e. they do not imply the need for any physically coupled growth of black hole and bulge mass, for example through feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Provided some physics for the absolute normalisation, the creation of the scaling relations can be fully explained by the hierarchical assembly of black hole and stellar mass through galaxy merging, from an initially uncorrelated distribution of BH and stellar masses in the early Universe. We show this with a suite of dark matter halo merger trees for which we make assumptions about (uncorrelated) black hole and stellar mass values at early cosmic times. We then follow the halos in the presence of global star formation and black hole accretion recipes that (i) work without any coupling of the two properties per individual galaxy and (ii) correctly reproduce the observed star formation and black hole accretion rate density in the Universe. With disk-to-bulge conversion in mergers included, our simulations even create the observed slope of $\sim$1.1 for the M_BH-M_bulge-relations at z=0. This also implies that AGN feedback is not a required (though still a possible) ingredient in galaxy evolution. In light of this, other mechanisms that can be invoked to truncate star formation in massive galaxies are equally justified.},

abstract = {We aim to find the optimal site locations for a hypothetical network of 1-3 triangular gravitational-wave telescopes. We define the following N-telescope figures of merit and construct three corresponding metrics: (a) capability of reconstructing the signal polarization; (b) accuracy in source localization; and (c) accuracy in reconstructing the parameters of a standard binary source. We also define a combined metric that takes into account the three figures of merit with practically equal weight. After constructing a geomap of possible telescope sites, we give the optimal 2-telescope networks for the four figures of merit separately in example cases where the location of the first telescope has been predetermined. We found that the optimal site locations for a second telescope based on the combined metric form a +/-7 deg annulus at an angular distance of $\sim$130 deg from the location of the first telescope. Based on this result we conclude that placing the first telescope to Australia provides the most options for optimal site selection when extending the network with a second instrument. We suggest geographical regions where a potential second and third telescope could be placed to get optimal network performance in terms of our figures of merit. Additionally, we use a similar approach to find the optimal location and orientation for the proposed LIGO-India detector within a five-detector network with Advanced LIGO (Hanford), Advanced LIGO (Livingston), Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA.},

abstract = {There exist a wide range of masses and types of stars that form compact object remnants: white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The stellar mass distribution is smooth, covering the range 0.1-100 Msun. It is expected that the masses of the ensuing compact remnants correlate with the masses of their progenitor stars, and thus it is thought that the remnant masses should be smoothly distributed from the lightest white dwarfs to the heaviest black holes. However, this intuitive prediction is not borne out by observed data. In the rapidly growing population of remnants with determined masses, a striking mass gap has emerged at the boundary between neutron stars and black holes. The heaviest neutron stars reach a maximum of 2 Msun, while the lightest black holes are at least 5 Msun. At first this gap was attributed to a paucity of observations. However, with recent determinations of the masses for more than 20 black holes, the gap has remained intact and become a significant challenge to our understanding of compact object formation. Over a decade after this gap was initially noted, we offer the first insights into the physical processes that bifurcate the formation of remnants into lower mass neutron stars and heavier black holes. Combining the results of full stellar modeling with multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of supernova explosions, we both explain the existence of the gap, and also put stringent constraints on the inner workings of the supernova explosion mechanism. In particular, we show that core-collapse supernovae are launched within 100-200 ms of the initial stellar collapse. This implies that the explosions are driven by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities rather than the delayed standing accretion shock instabilities, resolving a major debate in the supernova community.},

In the gauging of the general affine group A(4, R) and of its subgroup GL(4, R) in four dimensions, energy-momentum and hypermomentum currents of matter are canonically coupled to the coframe and to the connection of a metric-affine spacetime with nonvanishing torsion and nonmetricity, respectively. Fermionic matter can be described in this framework by half-integer representations of the covering subgroup. We set up a (first-order) Lagrangian formalism and build up the corresponding Noether machinery. For an arbitrary gauge Lagrangian, the three gauge field equations come out in a suggestive Yang-Mills like form. The conservation-type differential identities for energy-momentum and hypermomentum and the corresponding complexes and superpotentials are derived. Limiting cases such as the Einstein-Cartan theory are discussed. In particular we show, how the A(4, R) may “break down” to the Poincar\'{e} (inhomogeneous Lorentz) group. In this context, we present explicit models for a symmetry breakdown in the cases of the Weyl (or homothetic) group, the SL(4, R), or the GL(4, R).},

abstract = {We investigate where brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) sit on the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) activity, an established relation between the X-ray luminosity, the radio luminosity and the mass of a BH. Our sample mostly consists of BCGs that lie at the centres of massive, strong cooling flow clusters, therefore requiring extreme mechanical feedback from their central active galactic nucleus (AGN) to offset cooling of the intracluster plasma (L_mech>10^44-45 erg/s). Based on the BH masses derived from the M_BH-sigma and M_BH-M_K correlations, we find that all of our objects are offset from the plane such that they appear to be less massive than predicted from their X-ray and radio luminosities (to more than a 99 per cent confidence level). For these objects to be consistent with the fundamental plane, the M_BH-sigma and M_BH-M_K correlations therefore seem to underestimate the BH masses of BCGs, on average by a factor of 10. Our results suggest that the standard relationships between BH mass and host galaxy properties no longer hold for these extreme galaxies. Furthermore, our results imply that if these BHs follow the fundamental plane, then many of those that lie in massive, strong cool core clusters must be ultramassive with M_BH>10^10M_sun. This rivals the largest BH masses known and has important ramifications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of BHs.},

In this paper, we discuss the benefits of using Bayesian inference to obtain these timing solutions. These include the validation of linearized least-squares model fits when they are correct, and the proper characterization of parameter uncertainties when they are not; the incorporation of prior parameter information and of models of correlated noise; and the Bayesian comparison of alternative timing models. We describe our computational setup, which combines the timing models of tempo2 with the nested-sampling integrator MultiNest. We compare the timing solutions generated using Bayesian inference and linearized least-squares for three pulsars: B1953+29, J2317+1439, and J1640+2224, which demonstrate a variety of the benefits that we posit.},

Presupernova systems consist of a CO or He degenerate dwarf and a (potential) mass donor (main-sequence star = MS; low-mass red giant = RG; asymptotic giant branch star = AGB; CO or He degenerate dwarf = CODD or HeDD). Mass transfer is driven by nuclear evolution (E), capture from wind (W), a magnetic stellar wind (MSW), or gravitational wave radiation (GWR). For several scenarios, the composition of accretor, nature of donor, driving mechanism, and formation frequency (in 10-3 yr-1 per 1010 L_sun; in the B band), respectively, are the following: (1) CO, RG, E, 10-2- 10-3; (2) CO, AGB, W, 4; (3) CO, MS, MSW, 2; (4) He, MS, MSW, 2; (5) CO or He, near-MS, E+MSW, 3; (6) CO, CODD, GWR, 8; (7) CO, HeDD, GWR, 1; (8) He, HeDD, GWR, 5.

@article{Pizzella2005,
abstract = {In order to investigate the correlation between the circular velocity Vc and the central velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component $\sigma$c, we analyzed these quantities for a sample of 40 high surface brightness (HSB) disk galaxies, eight giant low surface brightness (LSB) spiral galaxies, and 24 elliptical galaxies characterized by flat rotation curves. Galaxies have been selected to have a velocity gradient <=2 km s-1 kpc-1 for R>=0.35R25. We used these data to better define the previous Vc-$\sigma$c correlation for spiral galaxies (which turned out to be HSB) and elliptical galaxies, especially at the lower end of the $\sigma$c values. We find that the Vc-$\sigma$c relation is described by a linear law out to velocity dispersions as low as $\sigma$c$\sim$50 km s-1, while in previous works a power law was adopted for galaxies with $\sigma$c>80 km s-1. Elliptical galaxies with Vc based on dynamical models or directly derived from the H I rotation curves follow the same relation as the HSB galaxies in the Vc-$\sigma$c plane. On the other hand, the LSB galaxies follow a different relation, since most of them show either higher Vc or lower $\sigma$c with respect to the HSB galaxies. This argues against the relevance of baryon collapse to the radial density profile of the dark matter halos of LSB galaxies. Moreover, if the Vc-$\sigma$c relation is equivalent to one between the mass of the dark matter halo and that of the supermassive black hole, then these results suggest that the LSB galaxies host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a smaller mass compared to HSB galaxies with an equal dark matter halo. On the other hand, if the fundamental correlation of SMBH mass is with the halo circular velocity, then LSB galaxies should have larger black hole masses for a given bulge dispersion. Elliptical galaxies with Vc derived from H I data and LSB galaxies were not considered in previous studies.

@article{Macedo2013,
abstract = {The nature and properties of dark matter (DM) are both outstanding issues in physics. The universal character of gravity implies that self-gravitating compact DM configurations are not only possible, but likely to be spread throughout the universe. The astrophysical signature of these objects may be used to probe fundamental particle physics, or even to provide an alternative description of compact objects in active galactic nuclei. Here we discuss the most promising dissection tool of these configurations: the inspiral of a compact stellar-size object and consequent gravitational-wave emission. The inward motion of this "test probe" encodes unique information about the nature of the central, supermassive DM configuration. When the probe travels through some compact DM profile we show that, within a Newtonian approximation, the quasi-adiabatic evolution of the inspiral is mainly driven by DM accretion into the small compact object and by dynamical friction, rather than by gravitational-wave radiation-reaction. These effects circularize the orbits and leave a peculiar imprint on the gravitational waves emitted at late time. When accretion dominates, the frequency and the amplitude of the gravitational-wave signal produced during the latest stages of the inspiral are nearly constant. In the exterior region we study a relativistic model in which the inspiral is driven by the emission of gravitational and scalar waves. Resonances in the energy flux appear whenever the orbital frequency matches the mass of the DM particle and they correspond to the excitation of the central object's quasinormal frequencies. Unexpectedly, these resonances can lead to large dephasing with respect to standard inspiral templates, to such an extent as to prevent detection with matched filtering techniques. We discuss some observational consequences of these effects for gravitational-wave detection.},

abstract = {The arrival times of gravitational waves and optical light from orbiting binaries provide a mechanism to understand the propagation speed of gravity when compared to that of light or electromagnetic radiation. This is achieved with a measurement of any offset between the optically derived orbital phase and that derived from gravitational wave data, at a specified location of one binary component with respect to the other. Using a sample of close white dwarf binaries (CWDBs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and optical light curve data related to binary eclipses from meter-class telescopes for the same sample, we determine the accuracy to which orbital phase differences can be extracted. We consider an application of these measurements involving a variation of the speed of gravity, when compared to the speed of light, due to a massive graviton. For a subsample of ˜400 CWDBs with high signal-to-noise ratio gravitational wave and optical data with magnitudes brighter than 25, the combined upper limit on the graviton mass is at the level of ˜6×10-24 eV. This limit is two orders of magnitude better than the present limit derived by Yukawa-correction arguments related to the Newtonian potential and applied to the Solar System.},

We calculate the merger-driven evolution of the mass function, and find that merger rates are 10 to 30 times higher and gravitational waves are 3 to 5 times stronger than previously estimated, so that the gravitational-wave signal may already be detectable with existing data from pulsar timing arrays.

With the help of semi- analytic expressions that make it possible to assess the uncertainties of the r-mode scenario due to the impact of uncertainties in underlying microphysics, we perform a quantitative analysis of the the spin-down and the emitted gravitational waves of young pulsars. We find that the frequency to which r-modes spin down a young neutron star as well as the characteristic gravitational wave strain amplitude are extremely insensitive both to the microscopic details and the saturation amplitude. Comparing our result to astrophysical data, we show that for a range of saturation amplitudes r- modes provide a viable spindown scenario and that all observed young pulsars are very likely already outside the r-mode instability region. Taking into account the finite observation time, we find that the signal to noise ratio for gravitational waves is smaller than previous estimates, but large enough to detect such sources with next generation detectors.},
